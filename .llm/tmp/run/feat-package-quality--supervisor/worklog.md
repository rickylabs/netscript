# Worklog: S1 — Package Quality (supervisor)

## Run Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Run ID | `feat-package-quality--supervisor` |
| Branch | `feat/package-quality` (off `main`) |
| Archetype | per wave (A1–A6) + `SCOPE-docs.md` |
| Scope overlays | `SCOPE-docs.md` |

## Framing

Supervisor run. The per-wave Design checkpoint, sliced implementation, and gates
happen inside each **wave's nested sub-run** (see `phase-registry.md` and
`.llm/harness/workflow/supervisor.md`). This worklog tracks supervisor-level
progress: group launches, merges, base-syncs, and escalations. The per-package
authority is the nested canonical run
`.llm/tmp/run/copilot-evaluate-every-package-jsr-release--package-jsr-alpha-release/`
— consume it, do not rewrite it.

## Pre-flight (done at hand-off)

- [x] Repo exists and builds (S0 merged to `main`, new-repo PR #1 / `9aced47`).
- [x] `plan.md` + `phase-registry.md` scaffolded and reconciled to the 27-unit surface.
- [x] Canonical S1 run + master program run carried into `.llm/tmp/run/`.
- [x] `docs/architecture/{STANDARDS,PUBLIC-SURFACE-PATTERNS,DOCS-STRUCTURE,doctrine}` present.
- [x] **Wave 0 launched and merged** (PR #3 / `eb8ae44`). Per-wave baseline re-audit is now the
      established pattern (each wave re-baselines its own units in `research.md`); a
      supervisor-wide `release-readiness.ts` sweep dir has **not** been populated yet — carry as a
      standing item.

## Progress Log

| Time | Wave | Step | Notes |
|------|------|------|-------|
| hand-off | — | scaffold | Supervisor `plan.md` + `phase-registry.md` prepared; run artifacts seeded; awaiting Wave 0 launch |
| 2026-06-04 | 0 | merged | `@netscript/shared` to alpha bar; PR #3 / `eb8ae44` |
| 2026-06-05 | 0b | merged | **Inserted** harness reinforcement + agent docs: 8-phase loop, two-gate PLAN/IMPL-EVAL, `plan-gate.md`, jsr-audit shift-left (PR #4 `82ad2a2`); `.agents/docs`+skills + reference-drift fix (PR #5 `d5d8e5f`); D4 drop (PR #6 / base-sync `76fbeb7`) |
| 2026-06-05 | 1 | merged | Contracts & schemas (runtime-config, config, contracts). Re-baseline: all 0 slow types (stale audit wrong). 27 slices. PLAN-EVAL PASS (adjusted +F-14/+F-17). IMPL-EVAL FAIL_FIX → fixed. e2e:cli `41/0/0`. PR #7 / `4c57867` |
| 2026-06-06 | 2 | staged | Reviewer staged the adapters wave: branch+worktree `wave2-adapters`, nested run seeded (`research.md`+`context-pack.md`), draft **PR #8**. Agent now in Research → Plan & Design. Awaiting PLAN-EVAL. |
| 2026-06-07 | 2 | plan-design-complete | Wave 2 generator finished Plan & Design: Design checkpoint complete, all 7 OQs RESOLVED, full A2 matrix selected, real dynamic re-baseline done. `plan.md` (18.2K) written; no `plan-eval.md` yet (PLAN-EVAL not run). **OQ-1 resolved by sub-wave split 2a/2b/2c (10/23/17 slices, each `< 30`)** → group-structure change, escalated. |
| 2026-06-07 | 2 | escalation+handoff | Recorded `escalations/wave2-subwave-split.md` (dependency-graph / group-ordering change → user brief per supervisor.md § 4). Promoted OQ-1 split into supervisor `drift.md`. **PLAN-EVAL handoff prepared** (separate session); see Handoff Notes. Supervisor does NOT run PLAN-EVAL. Awaiting user decision on routing (Option A: 1 PLAN-EVAL + 3 IMPL-EVALs, recommended). |
| 2026-06-07 | 2 | PLAN-EVAL PASS | Separate-session PLAN-EVAL via PR #8: cycle 1 `FAIL_PLAN` (judged pre-plan staging — plan.md absent), generator wrote plan + Design (`1933bce`), **cycle 2 `PASS`** (comment 4640656448). Evaluator fixed two small gaps in place per instruction #10: added F-16/F-17/F-18 to the gate set; clarified kv slice (merge into existing `adapters/`). Routing = **Option A** confirmed. Escalation RESOLVED. |
| 2026-06-07 | 2a | impl-handoff | Implementation authorized for sub-wave **2a** (logger·telemetry·aspire, 10 slices). Generator handoff prompt issued; sub-PR `…-2a` → `feat/package-quality`; separate IMPL-EVAL on completion. 2b/2c blocked on prior sub-wave merge. |
| 2026-06-07 | 2a | merged | 2a (logger·telemetry·aspire) merged to track via **PR #10**. Telemetry MEASURE-FIRST lesson: root-only doc-lint 2 → full-export sweep 168. Umbrella PR #11 re-established as the live Wave 2 integration branch; 2a base-synced in (`e5d54e2`). |
| 2026-06-07 | 2b | merged | 2b (kv·database·prisma-adapter-mysql, 23 slices) → umbrella via **PR #12** (`55f6108`); separate-session IMPL-EVAL **PASS** (1 in-scope fix: `database` `jsonUtils` slow-type/doc-lint). `@db/redis` migration assessed + deferred to a future track. kv `core/`→`application/`, `bridges/`→`adapters/`. |
| 2026-06-07 | 2c | bootstrap | 2c (queue·cron) worktree + branch forked off umbrella `55f6108`; seed run docs (`0a4e043`); draft **PR #13** into umbrella. Plan & Design handoff issued (separate session). |
| 2026-06-08 | 2c | merged | 2c (queue·cron, 17 slices) → umbrella via **PR #13** (`d078e5b`). PLAN-EVAL PASS → 17 sliced commits (paired doc-recording) → separate-session IMPL-EVAL **PASS** + Augment hardening round on the in-memory queue adapter. queue `interfaces/`→`ports/`+`utils/`→`validation/` (AP-16), cron `interfaces/`→`ports/` (AP-17). Caveats: `e2e:cli` triggers-health (out-of-scope runtime) + `cli` isolated-declarations debt. |
| 2026-06-08 | 2 | **MERGED (closeout)** | Umbrella **PR #11 merged → track** (`d4f971e`, `--no-ff`). Full Wave 2 (6 packages) complete on the track. Promoted 4 harness lessons (`package-quality-archetype`, `sub-wave-orchestration`, `validation`, `platform`). Local track FF `d931dc6`→`d4f971e`. |
| 2026-06-08 | 3 | launch | Wave 3 (`@netscript/plugin`, A4) bootstrapping: umbrella branch + worktree + umbrella Draft PR; first sub-branch + worktree + seed run docs + sub Draft PR. High-level research in the canonical nested run; Plan & Design handoff to follow (separate session). |

## Decisions

| Decision | Reason | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Nest the 2026-05 package-jsr run, don't rewrite | It is the canonical per-package plan | `RELEASE-PROGRAM.md` § 10 S1 |
| 7 waves = 7 phase groups | Proven Foundation-first grain (PR #96) | `supervisor.md` |
| Re-audit before trusting slow-type counts | Platform rewrite changed the surface | `phase-registry.md` Wave 0 |
| Insert Wave 0b (harness + docs) before Wave 1 | Wave 0 proved Plan & Design was not a gated deliverable; made it one | `lessons/plan-gate-design-as-gate.md` |
| Every wave from 1 on runs a separate-session PLAN-EVAL hard stop | Catch plan defects before code (cheap fix first) | `gates/plan-gate.md` |
| Wave 2 splits into sub-waves (2a/2b/2c) | 8 units exceed the Plan-Gate `< 30` slice cap; PLAN-EVAL PASS confirmed Option A | `…wave2-adapters/plan.md` §1; PR #8 PLAN-EVAL PASS |
| Gate matrix governs over archetype-doc gate lists | Wave 2 plan under-selected F-16/F-17/F-18 because `ARCHETYPE-2-integration.md` lagged the matrix; PLAN-EVAL caught it (reinforces **L-full-matrix**) | PR #8 PLAN-EVAL PASS; `gates/archetype-gate-matrix.md` |

## Gate Results

Per wave, recorded in each wave's nested `worklog.md`. None run at the supervisor
level yet.

## Worktree layout (parallelization)

The primary tree (`.genesis/netscript`) stays on `main` as the coordination
baseline; `.worktrees/` is gitignored. Each active branch gets its own worktree
under `.worktrees/<name>`:

- This S1 supervisor branch: `.worktrees/package-quality` (already created).
- Each wave: `git worktree add .worktrees/<wave> feat/package-quality/<wave>`
  (e.g. `.worktrees/wave0-foundation`). Independent waves can run in parallel
  worktrees; base-sync `main` → branch → wave first (`supervisor.md` § 5).

## Handoff Notes

- **Next supervisor action (DONE 2026-06-07):** Wave 2 finished Plan & Design. Escalation
  recorded; PLAN-EVAL handoff prepared (below). Blocked on user decision re: sub-wave structure
  + PLAN-EVAL routing. Once accepted, dispatch the PLAN-EVAL prompt as a **separate session**.
  Watch the two Wave-1 failure modes — both look satisfied in the plan but PLAN-EVAL confirms:
  (1) full A2 gate matrix selected (plan § "Full A2 gate set" lists F-1..F-12 + F-14 + F-15 +
  consumer gates — not under-selected); (2) OQ-1 split keeps each sub-wave `< 30` (10/23/17).

### PLAN-EVAL handoff prompt (dispatch as a SEPARATE session — supervisor does not run it)

> You are an INDEPENDENT PLAN-EVAL evaluator for the NetScript harness. You are a
> separate session from the generator and from the supervisor; do not implement and
> do not score code. Activate `.agents/skills/netscript-harness/SKILL.md`, then read
> `.llm/harness/evaluator/plan-protocol.md`, `.llm/harness/gates/plan-gate.md`, and
> `.llm/harness/evaluator/verdict-definitions.md`.
>
> Target run dir (Wave 2 worktree):
> `.worktrees/wave2-adapters/.llm/tmp/run/feat-package-quality-wave2-adapters--adapters/`.
> Read its `research.md`, `plan.md`, and the `## Design checkpoint` of `worklog.md`,
> plus `drift.md` (real re-baseline numbers). Archetype: A2 — Integration
> (`.llm/harness/archetypes/ARCHETYPE-2-integration.md`); overlay `SCOPE-docs.md`;
> gate matrix `.llm/harness/gates/archetype-gate-matrix.md`; debt
> `.llm/harness/debt/arch-debt.md`.
>
> Walk the Plan-Gate checklist box by box. Pay specific attention to:
> 1. Research re-baselined vs current `main` — spot-check ≥1 load-bearing number
>    (e.g. database "1 slow type + 22 doc-lint", aspire "20 doc-lint").
> 2. Open-decision sweep — confirm OQ-1..OQ-7 are resolved and none deferred would
>    force rework. Run your own sweep for any the plan missed.
> 3. Slice budget — each sub-wave `< 30` (plan tables show 2a=10, 2b=23, 2c=17).
>    Note the plan's prose says "~22/~14" while the tables show 23/17; confirm the
>    table counts are authoritative and within cap.
> 4. Full A2 gate set selected (F-1..F-12, F-14, F-15, consumer gates) — Wave 1's
>    failure mode was under-selection (missing F-14/F-17); verify no recurrence.
> 5. jsr-audit surface scan present with a slice addressing each named risk.
> 6. Accumulated lessons hold in the plan: L-sizing (<30), L-rebaseline,
>    L-full-matrix, L-defensive-io (queue/cron abort-cleanup tests planned),
>    L-no-coercion, L-runnable-docs (docs-examples_test.ts slices), L-e2e (e2e:cli
>    as the final 2c slice), L-no-backcompat (renames delete, no alias/shim).
>
> Write `plan-eval.md` from `templates/plan-eval.md` in the target run dir. Emit
> exactly one verdict: `PASS` or `FAIL_PLAN` (with each unchecked box + required fix).
> Do not evaluate code or unwritten slices. Two `FAIL_PLAN` cycles, then escalate.
- Base-sync `feat/package-quality` into the Wave 2 branch before implementation (`supervisor.md` § 5);
  log it in the Base-Sync Log.
- The evaluator for each wave must be a **separate session** from the generator.
- ~~Waves 3–6 remain `planned`; do not launch Wave 3 until Wave 2 is `merged`.~~ **Wave 2 merged
  2026-06-08 (`d4f971e`); Wave 3 launched.** Waves 4–6 remain `planned`.
- Standing item: populate a supervisor-wide `release-readiness.ts` audit dir, or formally accept the
  per-wave re-baseline pattern as the substitute and note it here.

### Wave 3 launch state (2026-06-08)

- **Next supervisor action:** Wave 3 (`@netscript/plugin`, A4 dsl-builder/plugin host) is
  bootstrapped (umbrella + first sub-branch + Draft PRs + seed run docs + high-level research).
  Dispatch the **Plan & Design** handoff as a separate generator session (prompt delivered to the
  user). PLAN-EVAL and IMPL-EVAL remain separate sessions; supervisor does not run them.
- Carry the Wave 2 enterprise-grade bar (`.llm/harness/lessons/package-quality-archetype.md`):
  package-quality is architectural, not type/lint cleanup. Watch the inherited `e2e:cli`
  triggers-health caveat — determine whether it is a plugin-host defect (Wave 3) or downstream
  (Wave 4 `plugin-triggers`) before scoping.
- A single A4 unit is well under the `< 30` slice cap, so Wave 3 is **not** expected to need a
  sub-wave split; the umbrella exists for tracking-surface continuity (per
  `lessons/sub-wave-orchestration.md`: stand up the umbrella before merging anything).

### Wave 6 (`@netscript/cli`, PR #43) — PLAN-EVAL PASS + generator launched (2026-06-16)

- **PLAN-EVAL PASS** (cycle 1/1). Evaluator: MiniMax M3, OpenHands run `27650808441-1`,
  comment `4723981498`. Genuineness verified: `agent-exit-code=0`, `summary_source=agent`,
  `agent_outcome=success`; verdict committed to `…/wave6-cli--research/plan-eval.md`
  (+ `plan-eval-v2.md`) at `1e299a72`. 11/11 plan-gate boxes; A6 scrutiny clean. 4 NON-blocking
  gaps (Gap #1 plan L161 stale file-list, Gap #2 worklog §Design LD-8 prose, Gap #3 drift W-2
  already-resolved, Gap #4 Phase-P dependency ack) folded into Slice 0.
- **Generator launched** (Codex WSL, native ext4 worktree `/home/codex/repos/netscript-wave6-cli`,
  remote-control CONNECTED, mobile thread `77d5db3f-7350-4715-a7d0-49681d5a43ee`). Brief committed
  at `b631c1e1` (`…/sub-agent-briefs/brief-slices-0-1-2-3-5.md`). Assignment: **Slices 0,1,2,3,5
  continuous**, per-slice commit→push, run-to-completion. Slice 2 self-gates on `scaffold.runtime`
  41/41. Slices 4 (Phase-P-blocked) + 6 deferred to a second assignment.
- **gh is NOT authenticated in WSL** → generator cannot post PR comments. Supervisor posts the
  per-slice PR #43 comments from pushed commits (commit watcher `buaw7p3w6`), and triggers the
  separate-session IMPL-EVALs. Generator carries gate evidence in commit messages + turn output.
- **Next supervisor actions:** (1) per slice landed → post PR #43 comment + launch IMPL-EVAL
  (separate OpenHands session) + independently re-verify raw evidence; (2) after Slice 2 green →
  confirm Phase P scope/credentials with maintainer, run `chore/jsr-alpha-publish`; (3) after
  Phase P → second generator assignment for Slices 4 + 6; (4) merge wave `--no-ff`, then closeout.

## 2026-06-17 — Wave 6 generator Assignment 1 COMPLETE (Slices 0,1,2,3,5)

- **What:** The continuous Codex WSL generator (thread `77d5db3f`, worktree
  `/home/codex/repos/netscript-wave6-cli`) finished its assignment end-to-end, committing+pushing
  per slice as briefed. Supervisor posted a PR #43 comment + independently re-verified each from
  pushed evidence (gh unauth in WSL).
  - Slice 0 prep hygiene `96954206` (comment 4724170091)
  - Slice 1 CLI standards doc `fa3fe22b` (4724187857)
  - Slice 2 command registry + deploy-port E2E `2e18ebd4` — **load-bearing `scaffold.runtime`
    41/41 confirmed from raw logs** (4724270592)
  - Slice 3 split registry + app writer `e53f0114` (4724304277); drift D-W6-3 (split-in-place to
    avoid kernel→maintainer F-CLI-4 violation)
  - Slice 5 Aspire verify-only + schema mirror + flag-off `WithProcessCommand` seam `443d69f5`
    (4724348222); drift D-W6-4
- **Open items before wave merge:**
  1. **Batched dual-session IMPL-EVAL** over Slices 0–3,5 (separate OpenHands) — pending launch.
  2. **RED test triage:** generator honestly flagged repo-wide `deno task test` = 477 passed /
     11 failed / 12 ignored, outside CLI slice scope. Classify pre-existing-vs-regression.
  3. **Phase P** JSR alpha.0 publish (28 members except `@netscript/cli`) — **BLOCKED on
     maintainer scope/credential confirmation** (brief requirement). Slice 4 asserts against the
     `scaffold.published.runtime` fixture that Phase P unlocks, so Assignment 2 (Slices 4+6)
     cannot start until Phase P lands.
- **Severity:** on-track. Dual-session eval + load-bearing gate intact.

## 2026-06-17 — Program reorder locked (D-SUP-W8); CI gate landed; Wave 6 Assignment 2 (4a+6) dispatched

- **Reorder (D-SUP-W8):** maintainer locked **merge-first / publish-second / finish-CLI-third**;
  **no JSR publish inside S1**. The old "Phase P = manual publish mid-S1" step (open item #3 above)
  is **dead**: it contradicted the S1 charter and inverted the publish-from-CI-green-`main`
  dependency. Recorded in `drift.md` (D-SUP-W8) + `phase-registry.md`; posted to PR #2 + PR #43.
- **Step A — minimal CI gate landed:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`deno task check` + `test` +
  `e2e:cli`, push/PR on `main` + `feat/package-quality`) committed `78e18435` on
  `feat/package-quality`. Full CI scoped to S2/S3. PR #2 + #43 now gate on it.
- **Slice 4 SPLIT (locked):** *4a* = scaffold-improvement CODE (plan rows 4.1–4.6 / E.2.2,
  E.2.4, E.2.6, E.2.7, E.2.8, E.2.9), validated against the **local** `scaffold.runtime` fixture —
  **unblocked now** (needs no published alpha.0). *4b* = `scaffold.published.runtime` vs the real
  published alpha.0 — **deferred to post-S3 (program step F)**. This supersedes open item #3.
- **Assignment 2 dispatched (Step B):** Codex WSL generator launched on the wave6-cli worktree
  (native ext4) for **Slice 4a → Slice 6** continuous.
  - Brief: `…wave6-cli--research/sub-agent-briefs/brief-slices-4a-6.md` (adds §2 CATALOG-OFF-LIMITS
    boundary from the D-SUP-W7 lesson; §0 locked-reorder context; explicit 4b deferral).
  - Session/thread: `019ed63b-a542-71c3-968d-f788eb7954c1`; launcher `/home/codex/run-wave6-4a6.sh`;
    log `/home/codex/wave6-4a6-run.jsonl`; started `2026-06-17T15:38:08Z` at head `4beb2d9`.
  - Steer via `codex exec resume` on that session — **never re-launch** (one active turn / worktree).
  - `gh` still unauth in WSL → supervisor posts the per-slice PR #43 comments from pushed commits
    and triggers IMPL-EVALs (same as Assignment 1).
  - Tree prep: 7 CRLF-renorm `…/openhands/*/request.md` files set `--skip-worktree` so per-slice
    commits stay clean (recurring Windows-side churn).
- **Still open (carried, now post-merge-ordered):**
  1. **Batched dual-session IMPL-EVAL** over Slices 0–3,5 (+ 4a,6 when they land) — pending launch.
  2. **RED test triage:** generator-reported repo-wide `deno task test` = 477 passed / 11 failed /
     12 ignored at Slice 5. Must be green or quarantined **before the S1→main merge** — the new
     `ci.yml` runs `deno task test`, so these 11 will gate PR #2.
- **Severity:** on-track. No framework code by supervisor; bookkeeping + `ci.yml` + dispatch only.
