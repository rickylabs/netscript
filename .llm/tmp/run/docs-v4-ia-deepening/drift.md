## D1 — PROCESS — Caveats identified but never tracked (doctrine violation)

**Severity:** process (systemic)
**Found:** 2026-06-22, on user review of the freshly-merged v3 docs site (PR #106).

**What happened.** Across the v3 docs program, caveats and capability gaps were written
into page prose (alpha warnings, "this page does not cover…", GET double-handling, etc.) but
were **not** harvested into any tracked surface — not `drift.md`, not `arch-debt.md`, not a
backlog issue. AGENTS.md operating rule 5 ("Drift is explicit") and the harness skill require
that, **at minimum**, every identified caveat/gap is recorded in the run drift file. That step
was skipped repeatedly.

**Worst instance — better-auth seam gap.** The `tutorials/workspace` track is explicitly about
**organizations / multi-tenancy**, yet it does not use better-auth's first-class `organization`
plugin (nor `twoFactor`, `magicLink`, `admin`, `passkey`, `multiSession`). Either NetScript
lacks the **seam** to mount better-auth plugins (a framework MAJOR) or it has the seam and the
tutorial simply ignored it (a docs gap). Neither possibility was investigated or flagged. This
is the canonical example the user raised: "if we are lacking seams then it's a major issue that
should be flagged."

**Why it matters.** Soft-failing on caveats produces docs that look complete while silently
omitting flagship capability and leaving framework gaps undiscovered. It also let a FLAT IA
ship (one page for @netscript/fresh, the Next.js/TanStack-equivalent container) without anyone
— supervisor, PLAN-EVAL, or the adversarial Codex panel — flagging the structural problem.

**How to apply (the permanent fix, Phase 2 of this run):**
1. **Caveat-harvest gate.** Every authored caveat/gap must carry a tracked reference
   (drift entry, arch-debt id, or GH issue #). A caveat in prose with no reference fails review.
2. **Link-integrity build gate.** A `featureGrid`/`xref`/nav href to a non-existent or
   non-corresponding page fails the build (no more soft-degrade to the nearest index).
3. **Seam-coverage discipline.** "Documented or implied but unseamed" features are recorded as
   arch-debt + backlog issues; the seam-coverage matrix (Phase 0 scout) is the source of truth.

**Status:** OPEN — Phase-0 seam audit LANDED (see `seam-coverage.md`). Result: the framework has
**one** real build-seam gap (better-auth plugin passthrough on `createNetscriptBetterAuth`); every
other capability is already honestly seamed or honestly documented-as-limitation. So the systemic
risk was process, not breadth. Per-feature build-vs-doc disposition surfaced to the user 2026-06-22.
Remediation gates (caveat-harvest, link-integrity build gate, seam-coverage discipline) move into
Phase 2 of this run.

## D2 — MINOR — Saga runtime symbol drift in planning artifacts

**Severity:** minor (planning-artifact accuracy; would become a published-page defect if uncaught)
**Found:** 2026-06-22, PLAN-EVAL cycle 1 (OpenHands minimax-M3) Required Fix #1.

**What happened.** `seam-coverage.md` listed the saga runtime constructor as
`createDurableSagaRuntime`. The real `@netscript/plugin-sagas-core` export is `createSagaRuntime`
(`packages/plugin-sagas-core/src/runtime/create-saga-runtime.ts:73`, re-exported at
`packages/plugin-sagas-core/src/runtime/mod.ts:75`). It is reachable ONLY via the **`./runtime`
export subpath** — i.e. `import { createSagaRuntime } from '@netscript/plugin-sagas-core/runtime'`.
`deno.json` maps `.` → `./mod.ts` and `./runtime` → `./src/runtime/mod.ts`; `createSagaRuntime` is
NOT re-exported from the root `.` entry (`mod.ts`) and NOT from `src/public/mod.ts` (the PLAN-EVAL
cycle-1 note claiming a `src/public/mod.ts` re-export was WRONG — verified against source
2026-06-22). The `createDurableSagaRuntime` name survives only in historical run artifacts under
`.llm/tmp/run/` (`feat-prime-time-sagas-telemetry-spans--impl`,
`feat-framework-prime-time--supervisor`) — it was renamed in a prior run and the v4 research drafted
the seam matrix before re-spot-checking.

**Fix applied (this artifact).** `seam-coverage.md:61` renamed to `createSagaRuntime` (verified
against source 2026-06-22). `ia-tree.md` pillar-4 does not name the symbol literally (it references
"sagas tables"), so no edit needed there.

**How to apply (carries into build).** W2 (IA page moves) and W6 (Durable-Workflows pillar prose +
Reference leaf) MUST cite `createSagaRuntime` imported from `@netscript/plugin-sagas-core/runtime`,
never `createDurableSagaRuntime` and never a bare root `@netscript/plugin-sagas-core` import for
this symbol. This drift entry is the tracked reference the **caveat-harvest gate** requires for that
symbol.

## Risk register

| ID | Hazard | Trigger | Mitigation | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RR-1 | docs-v4 auth pillar documents the R0 plugin-passthrough path while the `packages/auth-better-auth` R0 (and R1 schema-gen) framework PR is not yet merged → published docs describe a path that does not yet install. | At docs-merge time, the auth-better-auth R0 PR is still red/open. | Either (a) hold the docs merge until the R0 (and, for the workspace tutorial, R1) PR is green; OR (b) every auth-pillar page that uses the R0 path carries an explicit "shipping in `<auth-PR-ref>`" / "awaiting R0" callout. IMPL-EVAL must verify one of (a)/(b) holds before docs go live. | Claude authoring workflow (supervisor) |
| RR-2 | R0 ships without R1 (plugin DB-schema generation) → a documented plugin that needs tables fails at runtime. | Auth pillar "Plugins" leaf authored while only R0 is built. | Plugins leaf carries the R1 schema-gen caveat at the PAGE level (not buried in the workspace tutorial). See `plan.md` W4. Tracked by `arch-debt.md` R1. | Claude authoring workflow (supervisor) |
