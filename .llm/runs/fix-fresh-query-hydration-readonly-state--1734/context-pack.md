# Context Pack: Fresh query hydration readonly/mutable type correction

## Run Metadata

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Run ID | `fix-fresh-query-hydration-readonly-state--1734` |
| Branch | `fix/fresh-query-hydration-readonly-state` |
| Current phase | `gate` |
| Archetype | `4 — Public DSL / Builder` |
| Scope overlays | `frontend` (contract-only) |

## Current State

Implementation and the preliminary complete static suite are green. Private guards validate
readonly unknown cache records before copying them into TanStack's mutable input. Exact 5.101.0
and 5.102.8 checks pass; public types, exports, and the `^5.101.0` range remain unchanged.

## Completed

- Required skills, harness workflow, static gates, doctrine, archetype, overlay, and issue read.
- Exact 5.102.8 failure reproduced and declared range restored.
- Dependency latest/why evidence and JSR/doc-lint baselines captured.
- S0 pushed and draft PR #1736 opened with required metadata.
- S1 RED fixture/test added and proven failing before implementation.
- S2 private boundary correction and behavior tests implemented.
- Focused tests/check/lint/fmt, quality scan (`allowCount: 7`), and arch check pass.
- Root check/test/lint/fmt, quality scan, arch check, and Fresh publish dry-run pass.
- Fresh doc-lint and JSR audit remain at their recorded inherited baselines.

## In Progress

- S3 final run-state commit and exact-head receipt rerun.

## Next Steps

1. Commit/push S3 run-state artifacts.
2. Rerun every owner-required receipt without modifying files.
3. Update the draft PR body/comment with exact-head evidence and hand off to Tier-A/IMPL-EVAL.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keep `^5.101.0` | plan D1 | Support entire range. |
| Keep public `DehydratedState` unchanged | plan D2 | No mutable widening or upstream leak. |

## Files Changed

| Path | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.llm/runs/fix-fresh-query-hydration-readonly-state--1734/*` | new | Harness evidence only. |
| `packages/fresh/tests/query-hydration-version-compat_test.ts` | new | RED child-check regression. |
| `packages/fresh/tests/type-fixtures/query-hydration-5.102.8-deno.json` | new | Exact 5.102.8 no-lock config. |
| `packages/fresh/tests/type-fixtures/query-hydration-5.101.0-deno.json` | new | Exact 5.101.0 no-lock config. |
| `packages/fresh/src/application/query/hydration.ts` | changed | Private validated mutable conversion. |
| `packages/fresh/tests/query-hydration_test.ts` | new | Valid readonly hydration and invalid-entry behavior. |

## Gates

| Gate family | Current status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static | preliminary full PASS | root check; 4,246/0 tests; 2,045-file lint/fmt |
| Fitness | preliminary full PASS | quality scan allowCount 7; arch check; Fresh publish dry-run |
| Runtime | N/A | no lease |
| Consumer | PASS | exact 5.101.0 and 5.102.8 no-lock checks |

## Open Questions

- None.

## Drift and Debt

- Drift: historical Fresh doc-lint resolution no longer matches current 45-diagnostic baseline;
  a transient F-16 warning from colocated test placement was fixed before commit.
- Debt: no new debt; inherited findings remain outside issue #1734.
