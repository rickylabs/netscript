# Worklog — S8 #1720

## Design

The run extends the existing Archetype-6 CLI kernel/surface split. Generators remain pure renderers;
all process, filesystem, timing, and Aspire IO occurs in emitted runtime code or concrete database
adapters. Typed command arguments are the contract, `DbOperationRunner` is the orchestration seam,
and `AspireCommandExecutor` remains the process port. D-6 ownership is expressed once through
`RESOURCE_DEFAULTS.DbCliModeExcludeFromMcp`; no hidden-resource behavior is introduced.

The six committed slices follow the ratified issue order. Phase A provides static, unit,
consumer-compile, and scaffold evidence. Live AppHost evidence is deferred to the supervisor's
Phase-B lease and the implementation agent does not self-certify.

## Progress

- 2026-08-30: activated on `564d465c`; verified clean worktree and exact S6 stack base.
- 2026-08-30: completed issue, research snapshot, S2/S6 receipt, Doctrine, harness, and focused
  source review. Recorded the absent standalone fallback and receipt-index discrepancy in
  `drift.md`.
- 2026-08-30: began slice 1 with RED-first generator contracts.
- 2026-08-30: `s8-s1-red` failed as intended at base `564d465c`: 27 passed and 4 failed
  (three unique failure shapes). The failures prove the raw/rendered Aspire 13.4 seam remains and
  `<db>-cli`/`excludeFromMcp()` emission is absent. Receipt:
  `receipts/01-red-generator-tests.json`.

## Push trail

Each committed slice is pushed only to
`origin:refs/heads/feat/aspire-13-5-s8-typed-resource-commands`; the concrete SHA and receipt are
appended after each push and mirrored in the draft PR comment trail.
