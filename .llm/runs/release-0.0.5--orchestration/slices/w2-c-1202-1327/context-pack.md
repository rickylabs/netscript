# W2-C context pack

## Current phase

Tier-A remediation and renewed serialized gate. The two accidentally replaced
`isNoRunningAppHostOutput` tests are restored alongside the new environment-forwarding test. The
selector repair is already focused-green, and Tier-A granted one fresh `scaffold.runtime` pass to
execute the four previously omitted W2-C acceptance gates.

## Identity

- Worktree: `/home/codex/repos/ns005-w2c`
- Branch: `fix/cli-db-live-endpoint-and-migrate-artifact`
- Base: `origin/main@c383b2e84`
- Draft PR: #1393
- Evaluator: orchestrator-launched separate Claude/Fable session per current supervisor prompt

## Locked boundary

- Close #1327 only when artifact acceptance is fully evidenced.
- Reference #1202 without a closing keyword. Never claim the owner-machine collision identity or
  three consecutive owner-machine runtime passes.
- Never run the serialized `scaffold.runtime` gate without a grant.

## Key facts

- Fixed `3001` default was already removed by PR #1211; this slice proves fresh live DB endpoint
  injection across two allocations.
- `runMigration` currently switches to `migrate deploy` whenever a database URI exists, producing
  #1327's false green despite a separate `db deploy` verb.
- The 2026-08-09 pre/post leak reports contain no W2-C-owned survivor. The sole reported container
  belongs to `/home/codex/repos/w6-review-desk` and was deliberately left untouched.
- The `--name` environment-key repair is required by #1327's named-artifact acceptance, not adjacent
  scope.
