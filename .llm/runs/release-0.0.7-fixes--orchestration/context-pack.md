# Context pack — release 0.0.7 fixes topic

## Control plane

- Coordinator artifacts: `/home/codex/repos/netscript-547-lffix/.llm/runs/release-0.0.7--orchestration/`.
  Read `briefs/reset-gates/dispatch.json` after the central state; it supersedes every earlier route
  matrix. The absolute topic contract is `briefs/topic-claude-reset-common.md`.
- Coordinator `codex-root-0.0.7` (Codex session `019ffaa3-32ae-7b02-92a5-d7ae146d8cbd`) holds sole
  merge/publish/relabel/close and central-state authority. This lane supervises only.
- Active controller: native Claude · Opus 5 · high, session `c7597d28-6774-44c9-aa00-b8b40b776165`,
  PID `2430399`, bridge `session_014pCd2QWkCscgZpVdjcUPST`, Remote Control attached. Predecessor
  Codex thread `019ffcc0-e1ae-7b70-b3b8-8804ebd6f773` is parked (`TOPIC_CONTROLLER_PARKED`, idle) and
  must never be resumed as topic controller. Full identity proof is in `supervisor.md`.
- Immutable dispatch base and current live `origin/main`: `01e0960494c95ce56eb35892c211a095eb13e6ed`.
- Approved plan head: `331f7c664`; coordinator control head at dispatch: `5330285f65242eff639cfc5c7ed68a80740de910`.
- Topic branch `orchestrator/release-0.0.7-fixes` has no upstream by design — push by explicit
  refspec only.

## Wave 0 state (verified 2026-08-14T22:56:20Z)

Both leaves are **held**, clean, and at exactly their dispatch heads. Both attached Codex threads
are idle at `task_complete`. Nothing may resume until the coordinator grants the specific serial
dispatch order.

- `legacy-port-pin-sweep` (#1243, PR #1643, `status:impl`): implemented and Tier-A reviewed at
  `e6ba15ec6414c0a42b1f9870791131162ea71c36`. Product diff is `plugins/auth/auth-plugin-command.ts`
  plus its test; manifest/copy port fields were deliberately retained as compatibility metadata.
  Blocked only on **dispatch order 2** — fresh native Claude · Opus 5 · low IMPL-EVAL.
- `scaffold-generated-output-correctness` (#1262, #1263, #1588, PR #1654, `status:plan-eval`):
  artifact-only at `14d8b38b4db7ba0635cbbcac2f8cd8903bee0ec9`, no product code, contract seams
  amended by the coordinator. Blocked only on **dispatch order 5** — fresh native Claude · Opus 5 ·
  medium PLAN-EVAL cycle 1. Only an unqualified `PASS` lets the implementation thread resume.

Both 2026-08-13 "coordinator decision required" blockers are resolved; see `worklog.md`.

## Constraints carried forward

- No global expensive-gate lease is held. `scaffold.runtime`, Aspire, and Docker remain barred until
  the coordinator grants the singleton lease; the grouped scaffold leaf has first topic priority when
  it becomes available, because its three-issue acceptance shares that one verdict.
- Zero Docker containers and no evaluator are running; one evaluator at a time, cluster-wide.
- Exact leaf identities and same-thread steering commands live in `leaf-registry.md` and each leaf's
  `codex-thread-ids.md`. Never send a second `send-message-v2` at an owned worktree — resume.
- Open coordinator item, non-blocking here: the generated DAG still tags #1360 `lane: fixes` while
  the leaf plan and cluster state place it in `features`. See `drift.md`.
