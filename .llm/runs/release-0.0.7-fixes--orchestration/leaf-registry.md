Every branch has no upstream by design. Pushes must use an explicit refspec. Exact observed route,
thread id, current head, and same-thread resume command are filled from the agentic launch records.

## Same-thread steering through the agentic suite

```bash
deno task agentic:codex-resume --thread-id 019ffcca-8bdc-7fb3-98c5-df90e2ae3b1f --worktree /home/codex/repos/netscript-007-leaf-legacy-port-pin-sweep --message "<follow-up>"

deno task agentic:codex-resume --thread-id 019ffcca-8be0-74c2-bb0e-c82cf5ce3c85 --worktree /home/codex/repos/netscript-007-leaf-scaffold-generated-output-correctness --message "<follow-up>"
```

Do not send a second launch to either worktree. The agentic sender registry owns both worktrees for
the lifetime of these threads.
