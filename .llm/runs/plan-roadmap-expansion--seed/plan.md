| Phase          | `plan` (PLANNING-ONLY — produces epics/issue drafts/briefs, no framework code) |
| Target         | Program roadmap: 2 NEW epics + 2 rescopes, all under #301 (Road to 0.0.1-stable) |
| Archetype      | N/A for the run itself; per-epic archetypes stated below     |

## Goal

A fully-designed, PLAN-EVAL-passable roadmap that folds the five owner topics into the program:
two NEW epics (`telemetry-revamp`, `dev-dashboard`) and two rescopes (docs-cut for C+D; `#327` for
E), each decomposed into sub-issues with acceptance criteria, labels, milestones, a dependency DAG,
and per-slice agent briefs — ready for owner ratification and a single cut cadence. The two
supervisor-delegated decisions (D-NSONE, telemetry grouped-trace flow) are resolved with evidence;
everything beyond the delegated set is surfaced as an owner fork, not self-decided.

## Scope

- **NEW epic `telemetry-revamp`** (enabler half of Spine-1) — `design/B-telemetry/`, sub-issues T1–T9.
- **NEW epic `dev-dashboard`** (headline half of Spine-1, ships as a plugin) — `design/A-dashboard/`,
  sub-issues DDX-0…19 (DDX-0…16 core + DDX-17 `DashboardPanelContribution` seam + DDX-18a-d
  per-capability sections + DDX-19 codegen-from-UI, from the owner-expanded BaaS source set).
- **Docs-cut** for C (tutorial rewrites) + D (positioning) — `design/CD-docs/`, S0 + C1–C6 + D1–D9 +
  V; delivered as a docs-only PR wave.
- **`#327` rescope** for E (desktop/single-process) — `design/E-desktop/`, #E1–#E8.
- The integrated cross-epic DAG, milestone train, risk register, gate set, and owner-decision
  register (this file + the per-epic `epic-and-issues.md`).

## Non-Scope

- **No GitHub mutation** (no issue/PR/label/milestone create/edit) and **no framework code** until
  the owner ratifies. PR #397 stays draft.
- Not deciding the owner forks below (milestone creation, #232 fork, #327/#375, #349 scope, telemetry
  SDK-dep posture, positioning density, AI-invocation timing). Drafts present options; owner picks.
- Not the implementation of any slice (that is the ratified WSL-Codex / Opus-workflow / OpenHands
  execution phase, post-ratification).

## Hidden Scope (a naive read would miss)

- **The flagship trace is a cross-epic co-land, not two independent epics.** `dev-dashboard` DDX-8
  renders a *severed* trace unless `telemetry-revamp` lands the streams fan-in span-links (T5), the
  triggers W3C-parenting bugfix (T4), **and** the oRPC span-creation fix (T6, a silent no-op today).
  The two epics must be scheduled to co-land at beta.6, not sequenced.
- **Four GitHub milestones do not exist yet** (`0.0.1-beta.5/6/7/8`). Every issue-filing is blocked
  on the owner creating them — a ratification-time action, but a hard precursor.
- **Docs authoring is blocked on a structural precursor** (S0 IA-reconciliation, WSL Codex) that no
  prose agent can skip.
- **D-NSONE's real gap is a missing fresh-ui L3 layer** (internal debt), not a borrow from eis-chat;
  the Directus extension taxonomy reframes it further as a *panel-contribution registry*.

## Locked Decisions

| ID    | Decision | Rationale |
| ----- | -------- | --------- |
| LD-1  | **Spine-1 = `telemetry-revamp` (enabler) + `dev-dashboard` (headline), co-land beta.6.** Two NEW epics under #301. | Dashboard's trustworthy trace view depends on the telemetry revamp; they are one coupled deliverable (verified: DDX-3↔T7 query contract, DDX-8↔T4/T5/T6 flagship gate). |
| LD-2  | **D-NSONE → promote the missing L3 `blocks/` layer into `@netscript/fresh-ui`; do NOT re-import L0–L2.** MCP-specific components out of the general registry for beta.6; `data-grid` NOT promoted (collides with the existing `DataGrid<T>` export). Extensibility shaped by the Directus panel-contribution precedent (`.withDashboardPanel`). | The **sampled** fresh-ui/eis-chat L0–L2 pairs are byte-identical (5 of 37 shared-name pairs verified; the other 32 are unsampled — research.md #1); the only real *structural* gap is fresh-ui has no L3 layer at all (#2). **DDX-0's acceptance carries a scripted full-tree L0–L2 diff as the proving gate** — the "do NOT re-import" call holds unless that diff surfaces a non-identical pair, which would be recorded as DDX-0 drift. Directus proves the extensible-panel-registry model (BaaS teardown). |
| LD-3  | **Telemetry grouped-trace flow = two-tier.** beta.6 flagship = **Flow B** (framework-native multi-process: eischat→workers-api→workers→oRPC callback→streams fan-in, with real span-links). stable = **Flow A** cross-language `duckdb.exe` hop (net-new span + `TRACEPARENT` env-carrier + language shim). | The hardest cross-language hop (duckdb, dark, needs a language shim + built demo) is honest only at stable; the beta.6 flagship is the representative multi-process flow that is mostly wiring already-emitting processes (evidence: research.md #5/#8). |
| LD-4  | **Telemetry provider posture = adapter-supports-both, default-thin, opt-in-SDK on the fan-in path.** `adapters/otel-deno` default (zero runtime dep); `adapters/otel-sdk` opt-in for attribute-bearing span links + flush-on-exit. | Deno-native span links are attribute-less (research.md #7), which collides with the beta.6 messaging fan-in requirement → the SDK adapter is beta.6-load-bearing, not a stable nicety. (Dep posture itself = owner fork OF-5.) |
| LD-5  | **Telemetry package restructure to doctrine ports/adapters** (kill `core/`, delete orphan `src/public/mod.ts`, real `./registry` facade, add `./otel` + `./query` subpaths) — closes the tracked Refactor arch-debt. | Package is structurally non-compliant today (research.md #6); the query/otel surfaces need clean subpaths to publish. |
| LD-6  | **`dev-dashboard` archetype = thin `plugins/dashboard` (ARCHETYPE-5) + fat `packages/plugin-dashboard-core` (ARCHETYPE-2)**, streams analog; `DashboardContract extends BasePluginContract`; `plugin add dashboard` needs NO CLI change. | Plugin-thinness/core-centralization law; the JSR-install path registers `provider.kind` from the manifest (research.md #4). The dashboard dogfoods the plugin system. |
| LD-7  | **Dashboard live data = Aspire `/api/telemetry/*` HTTP first, converging on `@netscript/telemetry/query` (T7) as it lands within beta.6.** The `TelemetryQueryPort` is the source-swap seam (no panel change). | Aspire OTLP HTTP API is the only working query path (the `aspire otel` CLI is broken, research.md #9); the typed contract insulates panels from Aspire's unstable internal JSON. |
| LD-8  | **Aspire dashboard seam = extend the existing contribution seam with a `command` kind (HARD beta.6) + `app` kind (preferred, Seam-B fallback).** Interactive prompts via command `arguments`, NOT `IInteractionService` (absent in the TS SDK). | Pin 13.4.6 clears `WithCommand` (research.md #3); the command kind is the honest "control the full stack" surface + the dogfood thesis; A2 forces the arguments route. |
| LD-9  | **E precursor = `@netscript/sdk` `ClientLinkPort` in-process adapter (#E1), NOT the mis-referenced 172a-2 seam.** Server `ServiceApp.fetch()` mount already ships; only the client in-process link is missing. | PR #172 is merged CLI type-soundness, unrelated (research.md #12, drift E1). The adapter is additive/unblocked. |
| LD-10 | **E ships as ONE tier-4 at beta.8 (no single-process-early / desktop-later split); tursodb single-writer relocates into the desktop composition root.** Option (b)→(c) ladder; stable holds only deploy-e2e (#E7) + signing (#E8). | eis-chat proved option (b) in prod; option (c) needs #E1+#E3; the single process is one lock holder (no os error 33) at a real-FS path — no native-addon-in-VFS spike (research.md #13, Opus-E). |
| LD-11 | **Docs land as a docs-only PR wave gated on S0 (IA-reconciliation, WSL Codex).** Authoring = Opus workflows (agents return prose, Fable commits); validation = OpenHands per-domain. Positioning law (build-efficiency-not-throughput, no honesty/candor framing) binds every child. | `capabilities/` (16 orphaned .md, never wired) vs 9 pillar folders is a structural blocker no prose agent can skip (research.md #11); the documentation-authoring exception governs the lane. |
| LD-12 | **#349 stays a WATCH sibling under #327; its tier-3 serverless scope is NOT merged into desktop Tier-4.** | 3-way "unified" naming collision (Opus-E); serverless bundling ≠ single-process desktop. (Confirmation = owner fork OF-4.) |

## The four epics (summary — full decomposition in `design/<topic>/epic-and-issues.md`)

| Epic | Archetype | Milestones | Slices | Merge-gate |
| ---- | --------- | ---------- | ------ | ---------- |
| `telemetry-revamp` (NEW) | package refactor + plugin instrumentation | beta.5 (T1–T2), beta.6 (T3–T8), stable (T9) | T1–T9 (9) | T8 real Flow-B e2e |
| `dev-dashboard` (NEW) | thin plugin + core (ARCH-5+2) | beta.6 core, stable depth | DDX-0…19 (**23** slices: 17 core DDX-0…16 + DDX-17 panel-contribution seam + DDX-18a-d 4 per-capability sections + DDX-19 codegen-from-UI) | DDX-16 scaffold.runtime join |
| docs-cut (C+D) | docs (authoring exception) | beta.7 | S0 + C1–C6 + D1–D9 + V-C/V-D (~18) | V-C/V-D OpenHands per-domain |
| `#327` rescope (E) | sdk/service/cli/db | beta.8 core (E1–E6), stable (E7–E8) | #E1–#E8 (8) | #E7 desktop deploy-e2e |

## Integrated cross-epic DAG + milestone train

beta.5 ── telemetry T1 (convention) → T2 (restructure)
beta.6 ── SPINE-1 CO-LAND:
          telemetry: T2 → T3 (adapters) → T5 (fan-in links) ┐
                     T2 → T4 (triggers bug) ─────────────────┤→ T8 (real Flow-B e2e) ▲ epic gate
                     T2 → T6 (oRPC span + AI-invoke) ─────────┤

beta.7 ── docs: [owner creates beta.7] → S0 (IA-reconcile, HARD precursor) → {C1–C6 ∥ D1–D9} → V-C/V-D → docs-only PR wave
beta.8 ── desktop: #E1 (sdk link) ∥ #E2 (#375 gen) ∥ #E3 (tursodb) → #E4 (single-process) → #E5 (offline), #E6 (packaging)

          dashboard depth (rerun-from-step, rich history, composite orchestration); schema-driven db tab (Directus precedent)
```

**Critical path to a shippable beta.6:** `T1→T2→T3→T5→T8` (telemetry) co-landing with
`DDX-0/2→DDX-3/4→DDX-5→DDX-8` (dashboard), with the T4/T5/T6 → DDX-8 flagship gate. The docs cut
(beta.7) intentionally follows the features being real so the storytelling is accurate.

## Topic F-ai (AI suite) — post-ratification integration (6th topic)

> `analysis/FABLE-STAGE-C-SYNTHESIS-F-ai.md`. **Verdict: EVALUATE-AND-HARDEN, not rebuild** — the
> five-home AI stack under epic **#238** is correctly shaped and doctrine-aligned; the gaps are
> capability depth in correctly-named-but-empty seams. This section carries its own LD-F/OF-F
> registers so the ratified A–E numbering is untouched. F-ai has its **own** Plan-Gate pass pending

### F-ai locked decisions

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
| -- | -------- | --------- |
| LD-F1 | **Evaluate-and-harden, not rebuild.** Reaffirm the TanStack-AI wrap (`@netscript/ai` engine + `ChatClientPort` seam); do NOT switch to Vercel AI SDK (Node-22-only, Deno/`npm:` friction). Keep `@tanstack/ai-mcp` behind `McpTransportPort`; `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` only if NetScript must be an MCP *server*. | Corpus + source re-verified: the stack is correctly shaped; eis-chat is the proof-of-pattern reference (consumes TanStack directly). |
| LD-F2 | **Flagship parity #388 is the load-bearing near-term spine (beta.5).** `plugins/ai` has no e2e/`verify-plugin.ts`/golden/doctor and its scaffolded `stream-proxy.stub.ts` **bypasses the `/v1/ai` contract** (raw POST, never binds `aiContractV1`). Parity includes `publish:false`→publishable. | `stream-proxy.stub.ts:16-64` confirmed; #388 (priority:p1) names exactly this. Precedes the dashboard AI panel. |
| LD-F3 | **Promote the flagship-quality-parity law into doctrine (beta.5).** New dedicated section in `docs/architecture/doctrine/11-plugin-thinness-and-base-seams.md` ("thinness is a layering choice, not a quality-bar exemption") + fix `plugins/ai/README.md` "thin" framing. Lane: Opus docs-workflow; validation OpenHands. | The law lives only as #238-c10/#388 today — no doctrine backstop; if #388 closes it has no durable home (biggest structural risk). |
| LD-F4 | **Generative-UI at beta.6 = recursive renderer + MINIMAL catalog + sandboxed-HTML fallback; full 30+ vocabulary → stable.** | The renderer (FA3 sandbox skeleton, `sandbox.ts`) is the load-bearing gap; vocabulary breadth is purely additive and reworks nothing (OQ-5). |
| LD-F5 | **The AI `TelemetryPort` GenAI-span adapter (FAI-17) == Topic-B T9; co-own, F-ai implements, milestone stable.** `@netscript/ai/otel` wraps `@tanstack/ai/middlewares/otel` (already spec-correct in eis-chat). File **once**, cross-labelled `epic:ai-stack`+`epic:telemetry-revamp`; hard-deps Topic-B T1 (attributes) + T6 (live seam). | Same work scoped twice would double-build; the adapter is `@netscript/ai` source so F-ai owns the lane. beta.6 dashboard is served by T6's live minimal span, not the full adapter (OQ-1). |
| LD-F6 | **F-ai is 18 slices FAI-0…17 (<30).** beta.5 parity+doctrine (FAI-0…4); beta.6 gen-UI + MCP pooling + capability e2e (FAI-5…9); beta.7 reasoning/BYOK/system-prompt/skills/memory/retriever (FAI-10…16); stable OTel adapter (FAI-17). #262 gateway/#247 orchestration/#271 write-gate/#256 paced-reveal/#272 MCP-bridge deferred explicitly. | Opus-F DAG, each slice cites a `file:line`/issue. #238's children currently at beta.3/beta.4 re-sequence into the beta.5–stable train (OF-F1/OF-F8). |

### F-ai epic entry

| Epic | Archetype | Milestones | Slices | Merge-gate |
| ---- | --------- | ---------- | ------ | ---------- |
| `ai-stack` hardening (#238 existing epic, re-sequenced) | package + plugin + docs | beta.5 (FAI-0…4), beta.6 (FAI-5…9), beta.7 (FAI-10…16), stable (FAI-17) | FAI-0…17 (**18**) | FAI-9 beta.6 capability e2e (gen-UI render + MCP widget round-trip) |

### F-ai DAG lane (into the train)

```
beta.5 ── ai: FAI-0 (/v1/ai impl + bind scaffolder) → FAI-1 (verify/golden/doctor) → FAI-2 (ai e2e) → FAI-3 (publish:false→publishable, gate:jsr)
          FAI-4 (doctrine backstop, Opus docs-workflow) ∥
beta.6 ── ai: FAI-5 (gen-UI catalog, fresh-ui) → FAI-6 (FA3 recursive renderer + HTML fallback) ┐
              FAI-7 (MCP pooling + ui://) → FAI-8 (mcp-app-call + widget, folds #257→#379)       ├→ FAI-9 (capability e2e)
          [dashboard AI panel OF-6 hard-deps FAI-0…3 parity floor; renders-gen-UI ⇒ hard-dep FAI-6 (OQ-3)]
beta.7 ── ai: FAI-12 (system-prompt assembly) → {FAI-13 (SkillLoader L1/L2/L3) → FAI-14 (--mcp scaffolder)}, FAI-15 (MemoryPort.recall)
              FAI-10 (reasoning/token-cap, extend openRouterReasoningModelOptions) ∥ FAI-11 (BYOK) ∥ FAI-16 (RetrieverPort → citation half trails to stable)
stable ── ai: FAI-17 (@netscript/ai/otel GenAI-span adapter) == Topic-B T9 ⇐ hard-deps Topic-B T1 + T6
```

### F-ai owner forks (OF-F1…OF-F8 = design/F-ai/open-questions.md OQ-1…8)

| Decision | Status | Rework if deferred? | Notes |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------- | ----- |
| OF-F1 (=OQ-1) **E9/#248 GenAI-span adapter ownership** — F-ai FAI-17 vs Topic-B T9 | **should resolve before filing FAI-17/T9** | Yes if both filed as independent build slices (double-build). | Recommend **co-own, F-ai implements**, single cross-labelled issue at stable; hard-dep Topic-B T1+T6. Do not file twice. |
| OF-F2 (=OQ-2) **Reasoning + BYOK are un-issued** — file two NEW issues | should resolve before beta.7 filing | No plan rework; changes issue count only. | Recommend file **two** (`epic:ai-stack`, beta.7, p2); FAI-10 is extend-not-greenfield (`openRouterReasoningModelOptions` exists). |
| OF-F3 (=OQ-3) **Dashboard beta.6 AI panel: invoke vs observe** (cross-topic w/ Opus-A) | should resolve before DDX AI-panel filing | Changes FAI-6 dep shape, not the slice set. | Parity floor FAI-0…3 is a hard-dep either way; renders-gen-UI ⇒ FAI-6 hard-dep. Confirm panel's exact AI surface with Opus-A/owner. |
| OF-F4 (=OQ-4) **beta.5/6/7 milestones do not exist** (shared with A–E OF-1) | **must resolve at ratification** | Blocks issue-filing, not design. | Owner creates milestones. `plugins/ai` first prerelease JSR publish → cosmetic `latest:null`, self-heals (not a blocker). |
| OF-F5 (=OQ-5) **Gen-UI vocabulary density at beta.6** | should resolve before FAI-5 filing | No rework — vocabulary is additive over the renderer. | Recommend **minimal at beta.6, full at stable** (LD-F4). |
| OF-F6 (=OQ-6) **#388 emitter count 6 vs 7** | safe to defer (FAI-1 reconciles) | No — in-slice reconciliation. | Source shows 6 emitters; treat source as authority, update #388 in-slice. |
| OF-F7 (=OQ-7) **TanStack pre-1.0 pin-as-gate** | safe to defer (accept-with-pin) | No — pin discipline is additive. | Recommend accept-with-exact-pin + upgrade-watch (eis-chat runs it in prod); add exact-pin lint to TanStack-touching slices. |
| OF-F8 (=OQ-8) **#262 gateway + #247 orchestration milestone** | safe to defer | No — both leave the near-term train. | Recommend re-sequence **back to stable** (neither parity-critical nor a dashboard dep). |

> **F-ai "must resolve now" forks:** only **OF-F4** (milestones — shared with A–E OF-1, a pure owner
> action). OF-F1 (adapter co-ownership) is "resolve before filing FAI-17" and is technically
> resolved by LD-F5 with a documented single-issue path — no design rework. No `FAIL_PLAN` open
> decision in the F-ai set.

### F-ai supersession map (DRAFT — owner-approved before any close; NEVER a keyword on #238)

Opus-F headline: **15 keep (12 re-sequenced into beta.5–stable) · 2 fold (#257→#379 render+act halves; #272 dependency-superseded by FAI-8) · 0 close/supersede · 3 new (FAI-10 reasoning, FAI-11 BYOK, + reconcile #388 emitter count in-slice).** Full mapping in `design/F-ai/epic-and-issues.md`.

### F-ai risk additions

| Risk | Mitigation |
| ---- | ---------- |
| `plugins/ai` first JSR publish (FAI-3) is the highest jsr delta (prerelease `latest:null`, JSR-safe asset embedding, full doc:lint) | FAI-3 carries `gate:jsr` with `deno doc --lint` full-export-map + `deno publish --dry-run` + import-attribute asset check before the beta.5 cut; `latest:null` documented as cosmetic. |
| FAI-17 / Topic-B T9 double-build | LD-F5 co-own single-issue resolution; OF-F1 owner ratifies before either is filed. |
| TanStack AI pre-1.0 breaking cadence | exact-pin + upgrade-watch lint on TanStack-touching slices (OF-F7). |
| gen-UI renderer scope-creep to full vocabulary at beta.6 | LD-F4 caps beta.6 at renderer + minimal catalog; full vocabulary explicitly stable. |

## Open-Decision Sweep (owner forks)

> **PLAN-GATE PASSED (OpenHands run-28716441078-1, minimax M3, 2026-07-04) — verdict of record:
> `plan-eval.md`.** **OWNER RATIFIED the plan 2026-07-04 ("absolute bar", authorized).** The two
> rework-forcing forks and the panel-seam fork are now locked: **OF-5 → allow opt-in OTel-SDK on
> fan-in**; **OF-10 → per-capability sections**; **OF-11 → `DashboardPanelContribution` contract
> owned by `plugin-dashboard-core`, NOT a core `definePlugin` axis** (overrides the earlier
> core-axis lean). Remaining forks (OF-1/2/3/4/6/7/8/9/12/13) are owner ratification-gates that do
> not force plan rework; OF-1 (milestones + `wave:*` labels.yml sync) is executed in Phase 2 filing.

| Decision | Status | Rework if deferred? | Notes |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------- | ----- |
| OF-1 Create milestones `0.0.1-beta.5/6/7/8` (+ epic labels) **and sync the `wave:*` label block into `.github/labels.yml`** | **must resolve at ratification** | Blocks issue-filing, not plan design. No plan rework. | AGENTS.md milestone obligation; pure owner action. **F1 found `.github/labels.yml` currently has NO `wave:*` labels** (only type/status/priority/area/ci/gate) though the taxonomy requires them — add `wave:v1`/`wave:v1-min`/`wave:defer` before filing. `wave:v2` is **not** canonical (drafts corrected to `wave:defer`). |
| OF-2 **#232 fork:** rescope-#232 (Opt 1) vs NEW `epic:docs-cut` child of #301 (Opt 2) | **must resolve before docs filing** | No rework to slice content — both options wrap the SAME S0/C/D children. Only the epic wrapper differs. | Opus-CD **recommends Opt 2** (#232's storefront-Run-2 debt partly superseded; rescope risks orphaning it). Both drafted. |
| OF-3 **#327 rescope** WATCH→Tier-4 + **#375 promotion** (`Closes #375`) | **must resolve before E filing** | No plan rework; confirms scheduling. | Draft delta ready in `design/E-desktop/epic-and-issues.md`. |
| OF-4 **#349 scope** — keep WATCH sibling vs fold into Tier-4 | safe to defer (recommend WATCH) | Deferring = leave #349 untouched; no rework. | Opus-E evidence: serverless ≠ single-process; do NOT merge. |
| OF-5 **Telemetry SDK-adapter dependency posture** (opt-in `@opentelemetry/sdk-*` on fan-in) | ✅ **OWNER RATIFIED 2026-07-04 — allow opt-in OTel-SDK on fan-in (recommendation adopted)** | **YES — deferring forces rework.** If the owner forbids any OTel-SDK dep, the fan-in span-links (T5) can't carry attributes and the beta.6 flagship trace design changes. | Default build stays zero-dep; SDK is opt-in. Technical direction locked (LD-4); the *dep-acceptance* is the owner's. |
| OF-6 **AI-invocation-at-beta.6** (pull minimal AI `TelemetryPort` invocation forward; full GenAI adapter stays stable) | safe to defer (recommend adopt) | Minor: if rejected, AI stays F at beta.6 (no dashboard AI spans); no structural rework. | Opus-B divergence; kills the inert-F seam cheaply. |
| OF-7 **Positioning density** (~13 one-per-major-feature competitor comparisons vs 2 today) | safe to defer to authoring | No plan rework; a density knob per D slice. | Opus-CD; brushes "sparse by design" — owner sets the ceiling. |
| OF-8 **Two net-new docs pages** (CLI/scaffold, MCP) in scope | safe to defer (recommend in) | No rework; S0 adds two nav stubs regardless. | Opus-CD. |
| OF-9 **Desktop-mode telemetry export** (no Aspire collector in a shipped binary) | safe to defer to stable | No beta.6 rework; desktop ships beta.8+. | Resolve as env-configured external OTLP via the SDK adapter (LD-4 makes this free). |
| OF-10 (=OQ-11) **Per-capability sections vs flat "Plugin Control list" at beta.6** — the IA shape | ✅ **OWNER RATIFIED 2026-07-04 — per-capability sections (recommendation adopted)** | **YES — the drafted beta.6 issue graph already assumes per-capability** (DDX-10 depends on DDX-17 at epic-and-issues.md; DDX-17 blocks DDX-18/10/19; DDX-18a-d are milestoned beta.6). A flat-list fallback would re-draft those slices' dependencies and milestones — real rework, not a smaller surface. | Opus-A **recommends adopt per-capability at beta.6** (it is the literal "the dashboard is how you drive the framework" thesis + it dogfoods the DDX-17 contribution seam). If the owner instead picks flat-list, DDX-17 + DDX-18a-d move to stable and DDX-10 loses its DDX-17 dep — a **documented fallback re-draft** the owner triggers at ratification, not a free deferral. |
| OF-11 (=OQ-12) **`.withDashboardPanel` realization** — `DashboardPanelContribution` contract owned by `plugin-dashboard-core` (thinness-correct) vs a first-class core `definePlugin` axis | ✅ **OWNER RATIFIED 2026-07-04 — contract owned by `plugin-dashboard-core` (NOT a core axis); overrides the earlier core-axis lean, now locked** | No plan rework — both realize the same panel-contribution capability; only the seam location differs. | Opus-A **recommended the contract-seam** (core must not know one plugin's surface — the dashboard is itself a plugin), with optional `.withDashboardPanel()` sugar. **Owner locked the contract-seam in `plugin-dashboard-core`**, explicitly overriding the earlier core-`definePlugin`-axis lean. |
| OF-12 (=OQ-13) **Codegen-from-UI (DDX-19) milestone + AI-on-codegen #238 handshake** | safe to defer (recommend stable) | No rework; DDX-19 is a stable-tier "Add resource" action (beta.6 stretch only if DDX-4 scaffolders are cheap to expose). | Opus-A: DDX-19 calls the same `createPluginAdapter().toScaffold()` (#157-safe); AI-on-codegen is a cross-epic edge to flagship AI plugin **#238**, NOT net-new dashboard scope. #238 owner must co-own so it is not built twice. |
| OF-13 (=OQ-14) **Schema-driven `db` tab (Directus precedent)** — Prisma-Next-gated | safe to defer to stable (track only) | No beta.6 rework; explicitly out of beta.6. | Opus-A: gated on the Prisma-Next DB-layer migration; track as a stable edge. |

## Risk Register

| Risk | Mitigation |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Flagship trace renders severed if telemetry fan-in/triggers/oRPC fixes slip | Hard co-land gate encoded (DDX-8 deps T4/T5/T6/T7); T8 real-e2e assertion goes red if any fix regresses; sequence both epics into one beta.6 cut. |
| Aspire `app`-kind embedding proves unavailable at 13.4.6 | Seam-B fallback (`apps.dashboard` app-registration) documented in DDX-1/DDX-5; `command` kind (verified) is the hard requirement. |
| SDK-adapter dep posture rejected by owner (OF-5) | Default-thin build already zero-dep; if rejected, degrade fan-in links to no-attribute (Deno-native) and note the reduced trace fidelity as accepted debt. |
| tursodb single-writer / Prisma engine fails inside a packaged `deno desktop` binary | Bounded validation baked into #E3 acceptance; real-FS path (not VFS) avoids the native-addon spike; option (b) is the proven fallback. |
| S0 IA-reconciliation breaks existing doc URLs | S0 acceptance requires redirects for all 15 moved pages + `deno task verify` green + grep-clean xref retargeting before any authoring starts. |
| Telemetry restructure (LD-5) breaks published subpath consumers | T2 acceptance: subpath compat preserved, `deno doc --lint` on the FULL export set, `deno publish --dry-run` green. |
| Roadmap scope (51 slices) overwhelms a single cut | Milestones stagger the load (beta.5 foundation → beta.6 spine → beta.7 docs → beta.8 desktop → stable tail); each epic has its own merge-gate. |
| Post-ratification lane drift (Fable writing framework code) | Lane law encoded per slice in `agent-briefs.md`: WSL Codex for framework/plugin/sdk/db, Opus workflows for docs prose only, OpenHands for validation. |

## Fitness Gates (per-epic gate set, from the archetype-gate-matrix + overlays)

| Gate | telemetry | dashboard | docs | desktop |
| ---- | --------- | --------- | ---- | ------- |
| `deno task check` (+`--unstable-kv`) | yes | yes | n/a | yes |
| `deno task arch:check` | yes (LD-5) | yes (core layering) | n/a | yes |
| `jsr` / `deno doc --lint` full export set | yes (T2/T7) | yes (core + fresh-ui L3) | n/a | yes (#E1 sdk surface) |
| `deno publish:dry-run` | yes (T2) | yes | n/a | yes |
| `scaffold.runtime` e2e | T8 (Flow-B assertions) | DDX-16 (dashboard join) | n/a | n/a |
| `deno task verify` (docs build+links+caveats) | n/a | n/a | S0 + every C/D slice | n/a |
| deploy-e2e (extends #394) | n/a | n/a | n/a | #E7 (stable) |
| contract base-seam soundness test (2 accepted casts only) | n/a | DDX-2 | n/a | #E1 round-trip parity |

## Arch-Debt Implications

| Entry | Action | Notes |
| ----- | ------ | ----- |
| `packages/telemetry` Refactor (tracked) | **close** via T2 | evidence F-3/F-5/F-6; ports/adapters + subpaths. |
| triggers W3C-parenting bug | **fix** via T4 | regression test asserts ingress+process share traceId. |
| streams / ai instrumentation = F | **resolve** via T5 / T6 | from-zero PRODUCER/CONSUMER spans (streams); live `TelemetryPort` invocation (ai). |
| fresh-ui missing L3 layer | **resolve** via DDX-0 | add the blocks registry; internal debt independent of D-NSONE. |
| `aspire otel` CLI broken | **note (do not fix here)** | dashboard routes around it via the HTTP API (LD-7); track separately. |
| docs `capabilities/` orphan IA | **resolve** via S0 | promote into pillars + redirects. |

## jsr-audit surface scan

See `research.md` § jsr-audit — the planned public-surface deltas (`@netscript/fresh-ui` L3 blocks;
`@netscript/telemetry` `./otel` + `./query` subpaths + restructure; `@netscript/sdk` `ClientLinkPort`;
NEW `packages/plugin-dashboard-core` + `plugins/dashboard`) with slow-type risks, each addressed by a
named slice with a `gate:jsr` acceptance criterion. Per-package deep scans re-run at each slice's
IMPL-EVAL.

## Commit-slice framing (Plan-Gate "commit slices < 30")

Two levels, both satisfying the bound:
- **This planning run's own slices** (~11 artifact commits, A→G): specs read → eis-chat staged →
  B corpus → drift → stage-C synthesis → research.md → 4 Opus proposals → BaaS addendum → plan.md +
  ## Design → F1 fixes → PLAN-EVAL. Well under 30.
- **Each ratified epic's implementation slices** are enumerated, ordered, and sized in its
  `epic-and-issues.md`, each < 30: telemetry 9, dashboard **23** (DDX-0…16 = 17, DDX-17, DDX-18a-d =
  4, DDX-19), docs ~18, desktop 8. No single epic exceeds the bound; each slice names its proving
  gate + files.

## Deferred Scope (explicit)

- **stable-tier:** telemetry AI GenAI-semconv adapter + Flow-A duckdb cross-language hop + rich AI
  trace views (T9); dashboard rerun-from-step, multi-altitude run history, composite orchestration,
  saved views; desktop deploy-e2e (#E7) + signing automation (#E8); Directus-style schema-driven
  `db` tab.
- **Explicitly out of this program:** baggage propagation (semconv Candidate); dual-write to an
  external telemetry backend (app's OTLP-exporter choice); #349 tier-3 serverless (WATCH sibling);
  MCP-content dashboard panels (unless the panel IA adopts them — owner fork territory).

## Dependencies

- External: Aspire 13.4.6 pin (verified); Turso Sync API (#E5); `deno desktop` (#E2/#E6); OpenTelemetry
  SDK (opt-in, OF-5); minimax M3 for PLAN-EVAL (stage G); WSL Codex daemon for F1 + implementation.
- Internal foundations: #393/#394 deploy-e2e harness (desktop #E7); the shipped `ServiceApp.fetch()`
  seam (#E1); the fresh-ui copy-source registry (DDX-0).

## Drift Watch (log to drift.md if these change)

- Aspire `app`-kind embedding availability at the pinned version (DDX-1 fallback trigger).
- Whether `@netscript/ai` publishes before the beta.7 window (gates C5/D9 docs form).
- MCP HTTP-transport traceparent propagation (T9) and the streams real-consumer wiring (T8) — the two
  corpus "unconfirmed" items Opus-B flagged.
- Owner ratification outcomes for OF-1…OF-9 (any change reshapes milestones/labels).
