# Use AI coding agents

Aspire provides a first-class setup experience for AI coding agents. Run `aspire agent init` in your
project and your AI assistant — whether it's GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, or another
<abbr title="Model Context Protocol" data-tooltip-placement="top">MCP</abbr>-compatible tool — can
immediately understand, build, debug, and monitor your distributed applications.

## Why Aspire for coding agents

Aspire gives coding agents the same visibility into your running application that a developer has.
The resource data, structured logs, and distributed traces you see in the
[Aspire Dashboard](/dashboard/overview/) are exposed to agents through the
[Aspire MCP server](/get-started/aspire-mcp-server/) and the
[Aspire CLI](/get-started/install-cli/). Whether a person is debugging in the dashboard or an agent
is diagnosing through MCP, they see the same picture.

The Aspire CLI is built for agent-driven workflows — commands support non-interactive execution to
avoid blocking on prompts, and many commands support `--format Json` for structured plain text
output. Key commands include `aspire start` (background execution), `aspire start --isolated`
(parallel worktrees), `aspire wait` (block until healthy), `aspire describe`, `aspire logs`, and
`aspire docs search`.

Aspire workflow skills installed by `aspire agent init` teach agents these patterns automatically.

## Get started

When you create a new Aspire project with `aspire new` or `aspire init`, you're prompted to
configure AI agent environments. You can also run `aspire agent init` at any time to set up or
update the configuration.

1. Open a terminal in your Aspire project directory (the folder containing your AppHost).

1. Run the following command:

   ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
   aspire agent init
   ```

1. Select the **skill locations**, **skills and tools**, and optional MCP server configuration for
   the agent environments you use.

     For details about skill locations, workflow skills, Playwright CLI, and
     dotnet-inspect, see [Aspire skills](/get-started/aspire-skills/).

## What gets configured

The `aspire agent init` command detects your AI development environment and creates the appropriate
configuration files:

### Aspire skill files

Aspire skill files teach your AI coding agent how to use Aspire CLI workflows, route tasks to
focused skills, and call selected companion tools such as Playwright CLI or dotnet-inspect.

  skills](/get-started/aspire-skills/).

### Aspire MCP server

The MCP server gives your AI agent direct runtime access to your running Aspire application —
resource status, logs, traces, and commands. See
[Aspire MCP server](/get-started/aspire-mcp-server/) for configuration details, available tools, and
the security model.

## Migrate from AGENTS.md

If your project has an `AGENTS.md` file from a previous version of Aspire, you can migrate to the
new skill file format. Skill files provide better structure and are recognized natively by AI coding
agents.

1. Run `aspire agent init` and select the Aspire workflow skills you want to install.

2. The skill files are created under each selected skill location, such as
   `.agents/skills/aspire/SKILL.md` and `.agents/skills/aspire-orchestration/SKILL.md`.

3. Review and delete the old `AGENTS.md` file — the skill files replace it.

**Tip:** The skill files are more structured than `AGENTS.md` and include complete CLI command
reference tables, workflow patterns, and rules that the agent follows automatically. You can
customize them for your project's specific needs.

## Your first prompts

Once configured, start your preferred AI coding environment. Try asking your agent:

> "Start the Aspire app and show me the resource status."

> "Analyze HTTP request performance for my API."

> "Add a Redis cache to my AppHost."

## Supported AI assistants

The `aspire agent init` command supports the following AI assistants:

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/mcp-servers) with GitHub
  Copilot
- [Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/use-copilot-cli#add-an-mcp-server)
- [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp)
- [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs/mcp-servers/)

**Note:** The Aspire MCP server uses the STDIO transport protocol and may work with other agentic
coding environments that support this MCP communication protocol.
