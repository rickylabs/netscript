# aspire do command

## Name

`aspire do` - Execute a specific pipeline step and its dependencies.

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire do <step> [options] [[--] <additional arguments>...]
```

## Description

The `aspire do` command executes a specific pipeline step and its dependencies in your Aspire
AppHost. This command provides fine-grained control over the orchestration pipeline, allowing you to
run individual steps of the deployment or build process.

<Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/project-search-logic-description.md" />

The command allows you to:

- Execute specific pipeline steps without running the entire pipeline
- Run only the dependencies needed for a particular step
- Test individual pipeline stages during development
- Customize pipeline execution with environment-specific settings
- Discover available steps and their dependencies using the diagnostics step

## Arguments

The following arguments are available:

- **`step`**

  The name of the step to execute.

## Options

The following options are available:

- **`--`**

  Delimits arguments to `aspire do` from arguments for the AppHost. All arguments after this
  delimiter are passed to the application being run.

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-project.md" />

- **`-o, --output-path`**

  The optional output path for artifacts.

- **`--pipeline-log-level`**

  Set the minimum log level for pipeline logging. Valid values are: `trace`, `debug`, `information`,
  `warning`, `error`, `critical`. The default is `information`.

- **`-e, --environment`**

  The environment to use for the operation. The default is `Production`.

- **`--include-exception-details`**

  Include exception details (stack traces) in pipeline logs.

## Discovering available steps

Before executing a pipeline step, you can discover what steps are available in your application's
pipeline and understand their dependencies. Aspire provides two complementary tools for this:

- `aspire do <step> --list-steps` — a quick, compact listing of every pipeline step with its direct
  dependencies and tags. Available on `aspire deploy`, `aspire publish`, `aspire destroy`, and
  `aspire do`. Useful for a fast "what would happen?" view before running a command. The `step`
  argument is required when using `--list-steps` with `aspire do`.
- `aspire do diagnostics` — a verbose, in-depth report. The `diagnostics` step is itself part of the
  pipeline, so `aspire do diagnostics` runs it like any other step.

### Quick listing with `--list-steps`

Running `aspire do <step> --list-steps` produces a numbered list of every step in the pipeline, what
each one depends on, and any tags it carries. The `step` argument is required — `aspire do` is
always step-targeted, so `--list-steps` without a step has no meaningful scope. Omitting the step
produces a friendly error that suggests concrete examples:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire do deploy --list-steps
```

Example output:

```text title="Output"
1. parameter-prompt
   └─ No dependencies

2. provision-redis-infra
   ├─ Depends on: parameter-prompt
   └─ Tags: provision-infra

3. build-webapi
   ├─ Depends on: parameter-prompt
   └─ Tags: build-compute

4. deploy-webapi
   ├─ Depends on: provision-redis-infra, build-webapi
   └─ Tags: deploy-compute
```

Each entry shows the step's position in execution order, the steps it depends on, and any tags it
declares. Steps with no dependencies and no tags are shown as `└─ No dependencies`.

Use this when you just need to confirm a step exists or check its direct dependencies.

### In-depth report with `aspire do diagnostics`

For comprehensive information about your pipeline, run the `diagnostics` step:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire do diagnostics
```

The `diagnostics` step provides a deeper analysis than `--list-steps`, including:

- All available steps and their dependencies
- Execution order with parallelization indicators
- Step dependencies and target resources
- Configuration issues like orphaned steps or circular dependencies

This is particularly useful after installing a deployment package or when you want to understand
which steps will execute for a given command.

### Well-known steps

Aspire provides several well-known steps that serve as entry points for common operations:

- **`build`**: Builds container images for compute resources defined in the application
- **`push`**: Pushes container images to registries after they have been built
- **`publish`**: Generates deployment artifacts by serializing resources to disk
- **`deploy`**: Orchestrates the complete deployment process including infrastructure provisioning,
  image building, and application deployment

Resources in your application can contribute their own custom steps, and you can add
application-specific steps through the pipeline API.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate common pipeline operations:

- Quickly list the steps in your pipeline for a specific step:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire do deploy --list-steps
  ```

  This displays a compact view of every step with its dependencies and tags. Use it for a fast "what
  would happen?" check before running a pipeline command. A `step` argument is required;
  `aspire do --list-steps` without a step produces a friendly error.

- Run the `diagnostics` step for an in-depth report:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire do diagnostics
  ```

  This runs the `diagnostics` pipeline step, which produces a verbose report with execution order,
  parallelization, target resources, and configuration issues like orphaned steps or circular
  dependencies.

- Build container images for your application:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire do build
  ```

  This builds all container images for compute resources defined in your AppHost.

- Push container images to a registry:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire do push
  ```

  This pushes built container images to their configured registries. The push step automatically
  includes its dependencies (building images and ensuring registry availability) before pushing.

- Execute a pipeline step with debug logging:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire do deploy --pipeline-log-level debug
  ```

  Use debug logging to get detailed troubleshooting output during step execution.

- Execute a pipeline step for a specific environment:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire do publish --environment Staging
  ```

  Target different environments to use environment-specific configurations.

- Execute a pipeline step with custom output path:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire do publish --output-path ./artifacts
  ```

  Specify where publishing artifacts should be written.

- Execute a pipeline step with additional arguments:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire do test -- --configuration Release
  ```

  Pass additional arguments to the AppHost after the `--` delimiter.
