# aspire terminal command

## Name

`aspire terminal` - Manage interactive terminal sessions for resources.

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire terminal [command] [options]
```

## Description

The `aspire terminal` command provides subcommands for working with interactive terminal sessions
exposed by resources that were registered using [`WithTerminal()`](/app-host/with-terminal/) in the
AppHost. You can list which resources have a terminal and attach your local terminal to a running
session.

Because `WithTerminal` is experimental, the `aspire terminal` command group is hidden behind a
feature flag. Enable it before use:

```bash title="Enable the aspire terminal commands"
aspire config set features.terminalCommandsEnabled true
```

The connected AppHost must advertise the `terminals.v1` capability (Aspire.Hosting 13.4 or later).
Against an older AppHost the subcommands report that terminals are not supported.
