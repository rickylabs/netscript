# aspire doctor command

## Name

`aspire doctor` - Check the Aspire development environment for common issues.

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire doctor [options]
```

## Description

The `aspire doctor` command runs a series of diagnostic checks to verify that your development
environment is properly configured for Aspire development. It checks prerequisites such as the .NET
SDK, container runtime, and environment settings.

**Note:** The `aspire doctor` command replaces the hidden `aspire setup` command. If you previously
used `aspire setup` or `aspire setup --force`, use `aspire doctor` instead. The `aspire setup`
command is still available for backward compatibility but is hidden from help output.

This command is useful for troubleshooting when you encounter issues with Aspire or when setting up
a new development environment. The checks are grouped by category:

- **Aspire checks**: Reports the current Aspire CLI version and whether a newer CLI version is
  available, and suggests running `aspire update` when a newer one is available
- **AppHost checks**: Reports the AppHost Aspire SDK version when an AppHost project is present in
  the current directory
- **SDK checks**: Verifies .NET SDK installation and version requirements
- **Container checks**: Validates container runtime (Docker and/or Podman) availability, running
  status, and version. Reports which runtime is active and why (explicit configuration,
  auto-detected default, or auto-detected only runtime running)
- **Environment checks**: Reports operating system information (type, version, and Linux distro
  details when available) and validates environment variables and other settings, including the
  JavaScript toolchain required by TypeScript AppHosts (npm, pnpm, Yarn, or Bun)
- **Development tools checks**: When VS Code is detected, reports whether the
  [Aspire VS Code extension](https://aka.ms/aspire/vscode-extension) is installed

**Note:** The development tools check only runs when VS Code is detected, using the same signals the
CLI already relies on: the `TERM_PROGRAM=vscode` environment variable (VS Code's integrated
terminal) or `code`/`code-insiders` on `PATH`. If VS Code isn't detected, the check is skipped and
adds no output. When VS Code is detected but the Aspire extension (`microsoft-aspire.aspire-vscode`)
isn't installed, `aspire doctor` reports a warning with a link to install it from the Marketplace.
When the extension is already installed, the check passes.

**Note:** On Linux, `aspire doctor` reports a warning when `certutil` is unavailable. Aspire uses
`certutil` to query and update the NSS certificate databases used by Firefox and Chromium browsers,
so without it browser certificate trust may be incomplete. Install `certutil` from your
distribution's NSS tools package, for example `libnss3-tools`, to resolve the warning.

**Note:** On Linux, `aspire doctor` also checks the OpenSSL development certificate cache under the
dev-certs trust directory. It reports a warning when the cache is missing the current HTTPS
development certificate, is missing the subject-hash link OpenSSL uses to look up certificates by
directory, or contains certificate files that can't be read (for example, because they're corrupt).
In each case, `aspire doctor` recommends running `aspire certs
  clean` followed by
`aspire certs trust` to remove stale or corrupt certificates and regenerate trusted development
certificates. If the `openssl` command isn't installed, the fix suggestion also tells you to install
it first.

**Note:** Environment checks time out after 30 seconds each or two minutes in aggregate, and
installation discovery times out after 30 seconds. If a timeout occurs, the `aspire doctor` result
includes a warning.

The command displays results with clear status indicators:

- ✅ (green) - Check passed
- ⚠️ (yellow) - Warning (non-blocking issue)
- ❌ (red) - Check failed (blocking issue)

If any checks fail, the command provides suggestions for how to fix the issues and links to relevant
documentation.

## Options

The following options are available:

- **`--format <Table|Json>`**

  Output format (Table or Json). Use `Json` for automation scenarios or when you need to parse the
  results programmatically. Defaults to `Table`.

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-help.md" />

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-log-level.md" />

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-non-interactive.md" />

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-nologo.md" />

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-banner.md" />

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-wait.md" />

## Examples

- Run diagnostic checks on your development environment:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire doctor
  ```

- Run diagnostic checks with JSON output:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire doctor --format Json
  ```

## Sample output

When you run `aspire doctor` from a directory containing an AppHost project, you see output similar
to the following:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
Checking Aspire environment...

Aspire Environment Check
========================

Aspire
  ✅ Aspire CLI version 13.5.0

AppHost
  ✅ AppHost version 13.5.0 (MyApp.AppHost.csproj)

.NET SDK
  ✅ .NET 10.0.203 installed (arm64)

Container Runtime
  ✅ Docker v28.5.1: running (auto-detected (default)) ← active

Environment
  ✅ Operating system: macOS 15.5.0
  ✅ HTTPS development certificate is trusted

Summary: 6 passed, 0 warnings, 0 failed
```

After the summary, table output also includes an `Aspire CLI Installations` table that lists
discovered CLI binaries with their path, version, channel, install route, and PATH status.

When the CLI is out of date, the Aspire section shows a warning with the latest available version
and a suggestion to run `aspire update`:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
Aspire
  ⚠️ Aspire CLI version 13.5.0-dev is out of date. Latest version is 13.5.0-preview.1.26262.10
       Run 'aspire update' to update Aspire CLI.

AppHost
  ✅ AppHost version 13.5.0 (MyApp.AppHost.csproj)
```

This warning snippet is abbreviated. In complete table output, a summary follows the check results.
When any warning or failure is present, Aspire also prints
`For detailed prerequisites: https://aka.ms/aspire-prerequisites`. Some CLI and AppHost version
messages include an inline `(channel: <name>)` suffix; the same channel data appears in JSON
metadata as `identityChannel`, `latestVersionChannel`, or `pinnedChannel` when available.

On Linux, when `certutil` is not installed, the Environment section reports a warning instead of
failing the check:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
Environment
  ✅ Operating system: Linux Ubuntu 24.04
  ⚠️ certutil is not available; browser certificate trust may be incomplete
       Install certutil from your distribution's NSS tools package (for example, libnss3-tools).
```

On Linux, when the OpenSSL development certificate cache is stale, missing the current certificate,
or contains unreadable certificate files, the Environment section reports a warning with a
suggestion to clean and re-trust the certificate:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
Environment
  ✅ Operating system: Linux Ubuntu 24.04
  ⚠️ OpenSSL HTTPS development certificate cache is missing the current certificate
       Run 'aspire certs clean' and then 'aspire certs trust' to remove stale or corrupt certificates and regenerate trusted development certificates.
```

When only Podman is running:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
Container Runtime
  ✅ Podman v5.3.0: running (auto-detected (only runtime running)) ← active
  ❌ Docker is not installed
```

When you set `ASPIRE_CONTAINER_RUNTIME=podman`, Aspire honors the explicit configuration and Podman
becomes active even when Docker is also running:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
Container Runtime
  ✅ Podman v5.3.0: running (explicit configuration) ← active
  ✅ Docker v27.3.1: running (available)
```

The active runtime is annotated with `← active`. Other detected runtimes are shown with
`(available)`.

When VS Code is detected but the Aspire extension isn't installed, the Development tools section
reports a warning:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
Development tools
  ⚠️ VS Code is installed, but the Aspire extension is not installed
       Install the Aspire extension from the VS Code Marketplace for an integrated Aspire experience.
```

## Exit codes

The command returns the following exit codes:

| Exit code | Description                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `0`       | All checks passed (warnings are allowed) |
| `1`       | One or more checks failed                |

## JSON output format

When using the `--format Json` option, the output includes a structured response with all check
results, a summary, and discovered Aspire CLI installations. The following example is abbreviated to
focus on selected checks; actual output includes an entry for every check and can include additional
metadata, such as `updateCommand`, `identityChannel`, `latestVersionChannel`, and `pinnedChannel`.

```json title="JSON output"
{
  "checks": [
    {
      "category": "aspire",
      "name": "cli-version",
      "status": "pass",
      "message": "Aspire CLI version 13.5.0",
      "metadata": {
        "currentVersion": "13.5.0"
      }
    },
    {
      "category": "apphost",
      "name": "apphost-version",
      "status": "pass",
      "message": "AppHost version 13.5.0 (MyApp.AppHost.csproj)",
      "metadata": {
        "appHostPath": "MyApp.AppHost.csproj",
        "version": "13.5.0"
      }
    },
    {
      "category": "environment",
      "name": "operating-system",
      "status": "pass",
      "message": "Operating system: Linux Ubuntu 24.04",
      "metadata": {
        "osType": "Linux",
        "displayName": "Linux Ubuntu",
        "version": "24.04",
        "description": "Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS"
      }
    },
    {
      "category": "sdk",
      "name": "dotnet-sdk",
      "status": "pass",
      "message": ".NET 10.0.203 installed (arm64)"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "passed": 6,
    "warnings": 0,
    "failed": 0
  }
}
```

When VS Code is detected, the checks include a `devtools` category entry named `vscode-extension`.
It reports `"status": "warning"` when the
[Aspire VS Code extension](https://aka.ms/aspire/vscode-extension) isn't installed, and
`"status": "pass"` when it is. Its `metadata` includes `vsCodeInstalled`, `extensionInstalled`, and
`extensionId`:

```json title="JSON output"
{
  "category": "devtools",
  "name": "vscode-extension",
  "status": "warning",
  "message": "VS Code is installed, but the Aspire extension is not installed",
  "fix": "Install the Aspire extension from the VS Code Marketplace for an integrated Aspire experience.",
  "link": "https://aka.ms/aspire/vscode-extension",
  "metadata": {
    "vsCodeInstalled": true,
    "extensionInstalled": false,
    "extensionId": "microsoft-aspire.aspire-vscode"
  }
}
```

This check is omitted entirely when VS Code isn't detected on the machine.

When the CLI is out of date, the `cli-version` check has `"status": "warning"` and the `metadata`
includes the latest available version:

```json title="JSON output"
{
  "category": "aspire",
  "name": "cli-version",
  "status": "warning",
  "message": "Aspire CLI version 13.5.0-dev is out of date. Latest version is 13.5.0-preview.1.26262.10",
  "fix": "Run 'aspire update' to update Aspire CLI.",
  "metadata": {
    "currentVersion": "13.5.0-dev",
    "latestVersion": "13.5.0-preview.1.26262.10"
  }
}
```

The `apphost-version` check is only present in the JSON output when an AppHost project is discovered
in the current directory.

The `operating-system` check is always present and includes the following metadata fields:

| Field         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `osType`      | The platform family: `Windows`, `macOS`, or `Linux`.                                                                                                                                            |
| `displayName` | A human-readable OS name, for example `Windows`, `macOS`, or `Linux Ubuntu`.                                                                                                                    |
| `version`     | The OS version string. On Linux this is the `VERSION_ID` from `/etc/os-release` when available; on Windows and macOS it is the value from `Environment.OSVersion`.                              |
| `description` | A longer description of the OS. On Linux this is the `PRETTY_NAME` value from `/etc/os-release` (for example `Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS`); on other platforms it is the runtime OS description string. |
