# aspire publish command

## Name

`aspire publish` - Generates deployment artifacts for an Aspire AppHost project.

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire publish [options] [[--] <additional arguments>...]
```

## Description

The `aspire publish` command publishes resources by serializing them to disk. When this command is
run, Aspire executes publishing pipeline steps that have been registered in the app model (for
example, by environment resources). These steps serialize resources so that they can be consumed by
deployment tools.

The command performs the following steps to run an Aspire AppHost:

- Creates or updates the rooted `aspire.config.json` file and records the selected AppHost there.
  Legacy `.aspire/settings.json` files are still read during migration.
- Installs or verifies that Aspire's local hosting certificates are installed and trusted.
- Builds the AppHost project and its resources.
- Starts the AppHost and its resources.
- Executes all publishing pipeline steps registered in the app model.

## Pipeline summary output

After the pipeline finishes, `aspire publish` prints a result summary and a step-by-step breakdown.
The summary shows how many steps succeeded, the total pipeline duration, and a `Steps Summary:`
table.

The `Steps Summary:` table lists pipeline steps in their execution hierarchy. Top-level steps appear
at the left edge of the step-name column, and child steps are indented under their parent steps.
Each row includes the step duration, final status, step name, and, when the terminal is wide enough,
a timeline bar that shows when the step started and finished relative to the whole pipeline.

```text title="Output"
------------------------------------------------------------
✅ 5/5 steps succeeded • Total time: 0.43s

                Step timeline:                 0s                       0.41s

✅ Pipeline succeeded
------------------------------------------------------------
```

The `Step timeline:` header shows the start and end of the overall pipeline duration. The ruler
divides that duration into equal intervals, and each step row uses a bar to show the step's relative
start and end times. Very short steps can appear as a single point marker (`╴`). If the terminal
isn't wide enough to preserve readable step names, Aspire omits the timeline columns and keeps the
hierarchical step list.

## Options

The following options are available:

- **`--`**

  Delimits arguments to `aspire publish` from arguments for the AppHost. All arguments after this
  delimiter are passed to the AppHost.

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-project.md" />

- **`-o, --output-path`**

  The output path for the generated artifacts. Defaults to the AppHost directory's `aspire-output`
  folder if not specified.

- **`--pipeline-log-level`**

  Set the minimum log level for pipeline logging. Valid values are: `trace`, `debug`, `information`,
  `warning`, `error`, `critical`. The default is `information`.

- **`-e, --environment`**

  The environment to use for the operation. The default is `Production`.

- **`--include-exception-details`**

  Include exception details (stack traces) in pipeline logs.

## Examples

- Search the current directory structure for AppHost projects to build and publish:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire publish
  ```

- Publish a specific AppHost project:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire publish --apphost './projects/apphost/orchestration.AppHost.csproj'
  ```

- Publish a specific AppHost project with arguments:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire publish --apphost './projects/apphost/orchestration.AppHost.csproj' -- -fast
  ```
