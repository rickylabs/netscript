# aspire agent mcp command

## Name

`aspire agent mcp` - Start the
<abbr title="Model Context Protocol" data-tooltip-placement="top">MCP</abbr> (Model Context
Protocol) server.

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire agent mcp [options]
```

## Description

The `aspire agent mcp` command starts the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, which enables AI
assistants and development tools to interact with your Aspire AppHost. The MCP server provides a
standardized interface for resource management, diagnostics, and observability operations.

When the server is running, MCP-compatible clients can connect to it to:

- List and manage Aspire resources
- View structured logs and traces
- Execute resource commands (start, stop, restart)
- Query integration information

By default, the server discovers running AppHosts from the current workspace. You can also connect
directly to a standalone Aspire Dashboard (one not managed by an AppHost) by providing
`--dashboard-url`. In this dashboard-only mode, only the three telemetry tools
(`list_structured_logs`, `list_traces`, `list_trace_structured_logs`) are exposed; AppHost-specific
tools are not available.

## Options

The following options are available:

- **`--dashboard-url <dashboard-url>`**

  The URL of a standalone Aspire Dashboard to connect to instead of discovering one from an AppHost.
  Accepts a base URL (for example, `http://localhost:18888`) or a full login URL including a browser
  token (for example, `http://localhost:18888/login?t=<token>`). When a login URL is provided, the
  token is automatically exchanged for an API key.

- **`--api-key <api-key>`**

  The API key used to authenticate with the dashboard's Telemetry API. Only required when
  `--dashboard-url` is specified and the dashboard is configured with `ApiKey` authentication and no
  login URL is provided.

## Examples

- Start the MCP server:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire agent mcp
  ```

- Start the MCP server in dashboard-only mode using a login URL:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire agent mcp --dashboard-url "http://localhost:18888/login?t=<token>"
  ```

- Start the MCP server in dashboard-only mode with an API key:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire agent mcp --dashboard-url "http://localhost:18888" --api-key "<your-api-key>"
  ```
