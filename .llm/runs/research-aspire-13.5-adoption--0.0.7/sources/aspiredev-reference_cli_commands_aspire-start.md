# aspire start command

## Name

`aspire start` - Start an AppHost in the background.

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire start [options] [[--] <additional arguments>...]
```

## Description

The `aspire start` command starts an AppHost in the background and exits after the AppHost reaches a
stable running state. Use it when you want a detached AppHost that you can inspect later with
commands such as `aspire ps`, `aspire describe`, `aspire logs`, and `aspire stop`.

You can output detached startup details as a table or JSON, and you can pass additional arguments
through to the AppHost by using the `--` delimiter.

### Startup readiness and failure diagnostics

`aspire start` waits for the AppHost to report that it has reached a stable running state before
detaching. This means that early startup failures — such as TypeScript syntax errors in a non-C#
AppHost or C# compile errors in a .NET AppHost — are surfaced in the parent terminal instead of
being silently lost in the background.

When the AppHost fails to start, `aspire start` displays a curated excerpt of the startup output
that filters out noise such as package install logs and highlights the relevant error messages:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
Starting Aspire AppHost in the background...
❌ Failed to start the AppHost.
ℹ️ Recent AppHost startup output:
apphost.ts(1,15): error TS1109: Expression expected.
❌ AppHost process exited with code 2.
📄 See logs at <log-path>
```

For a .NET AppHost with a compile error, the output includes the relevant build diagnostics:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
Starting Aspire AppHost in the background...
❌ Failed to start the AppHost.
ℹ️ Recent AppHost startup output:
  Determining projects to restore...
  All projects are up-to-date for restore.
/work/MyAppHost/Program.cs(3,41): error CS1002: ; expected [/work/MyAppHost/MyAppHost.csproj]
Build FAILED.
    0 Warning(s)
    1 Error(s)
❌ AppHost failed to build.
📄 See logs at <log-path>
```

The parent log also captures the replayed child output under `DetachedAppHost/...` log categories so
the log file is self-contained.

Pressing <Kbd windows="Ctrl+C" mac="⌃+C" linux="Ctrl+C" /> while `aspire start` is waiting for the
AppHost to start will terminate the startup process.

### Configuring the startup timeout

`aspire start` waits up to 120 seconds by default for the AppHost to reach a stable running state.
If the AppHost build or startup takes longer than that—for example on a slow machine or in a CI
environment—set the `ASPIRE_CLI_START_TIMEOUT` environment variable to a higher number of seconds:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
export ASPIRE_CLI_START_TIMEOUT=300
aspire start
```

If `ASPIRE_CLI_START_TIMEOUT` is set to a value that isn't a positive whole number of seconds,
`aspire start` displays an error and exits without starting the AppHost. This behavior also applies
to `aspire run`, including `aspire run --detach`.

## Hot Reload and watch behavior

By default, `aspire start` starts the AppHost as a detached background process. It doesn't watch the
AppHost or resource source files. After you change AppHost code, restart the detached AppHost by
running `aspire start` again. For individual resource changes, keep the AppHost running and restart
or rebuild the resource from the Aspire CLI or dashboard when needed.

Aspire also has an opt-in `defaultWatchEnabled` feature flag. When enabled, Aspire uses watch mode
by default and automatically restarts the Aspire application after file changes:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire config set features.defaultWatchEnabled true
```

Use Aspire watch mode when you want Aspire to restart the AppHost-managed application for you after
AppHost changes. It supports both C# and TypeScript AppHosts; C# project resources are also
controlled by this setting today. Other resource hot reload behavior depends on the framework or
runtime backing the resource. For more information, see
[Hot Reload and watch](/app-host/hot-reload-and-watch/).

## Options

The following options are available:

- **`--`**

  Delimits arguments to `aspire start` from arguments for the AppHost being run. All arguments after
  this delimiter are passed to the application.

- **`--no-build`**

  Do not build or restore the project before running. Use this option when you have already built
  the project and want to skip the restore and build step.

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-project.md" />

- **`--format <Json|Table>`**

  Output format for detached AppHost results. Use `Json` for machine-readable output suitable for
  scripting and automation.

- **`--isolated`**

  Run in isolated mode with randomized ports and isolated user secrets, allowing multiple instances
  of the same AppHost to run simultaneously.

## Examples

- Start the AppHost discovered from the current directory:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire start
  ```

- Start a specific AppHost in the background:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire start --apphost './src/MyApp.AppHost/MyApp.AppHost.csproj'
  ```

- Output detached startup details as JSON:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire start --format Json
  ```

- Start the AppHost in isolated mode:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire start --isolated
  ```

- Start the AppHost with a specific environment:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire start --environment Development
  ```
