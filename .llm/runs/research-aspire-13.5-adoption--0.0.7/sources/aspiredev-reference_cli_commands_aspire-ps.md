# aspire ps command

## Name

`aspire ps` - List running Aspire AppHosts.

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire ps [options]
```

## Description

The `aspire ps` command lists all running Aspire AppHost processes. The output includes the AppHost
project path, process IDs, and dashboard URLs for each running instance.

The command scans for running AppHosts by checking the backchannel connections in the
`~/.aspire/backchannels/` directory. This approach is fast because it doesn't need to recursively
search for project files.

`aspire ps` provides AppHost-level information. Use `--follow` to continuously stream AppHost
lifecycle updates. To inspect per-resource details or stream resource state changes within a
specific AppHost, use [`aspire describe --follow`](/reference/cli/commands/aspire-describe/).

The default output is a human-readable table with the following columns:

| Column      | Description                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `PATH`      | The file path to the AppHost project               |
| `SDK`       | The Aspire SDK version used by the AppHost         |
| `PID`       | The process ID of the running AppHost              |
| `CLI_PID`   | The process ID of the CLI that started the AppHost |
| `DASHBOARD` | The dashboard URL with login token                 |

:::note Log file paths are not shown in the table output. Use `aspire ps --format Json` to retrieve
log file paths programmatically. :::

In-scope AppHosts (those within the current directory) are displayed first, followed by out-of-scope
AppHosts.

Before listing, `aspire ps` also detects and stops any orphaned AppHosts whose launching CLI process
has died (for example, after a crash or a hard kill) so the output reflects only AppHosts that are
actually running. This cleanup is best effort: if it fails for a given AppHost, `aspire ps` still
proceeds with listing the rest.

## Options

The following options are available:

- **`-f, --follow`**

  Continuously stream AppHost lifecycle updates. Requires `--format Json`. Output is emitted as one
  compact JSON object per line in
  [Newline Delimited JSON (NDJSON)](https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec) format whenever an
  AppHost starts, stops, or changes state. Each line follows the same schema as a single AppHost
  entry from snapshot JSON output, plus a `status` field (`running` or `stopped`).

- **`--format <Json|Table>`**

  Output result format. Use `Json` for machine-readable output suitable for scripting and
  automation. The JSON output includes an array of AppHost objects with `appHostPath`, `appHostPid`,
  `cliPid`, `logFilePath`, and `dashboardUrl` properties. The `logFilePath` field is `null` when no
  log path is available. Defaults to `Table`.

## Examples

- List all running AppHosts in table format:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire ps
  ```

  Example output:

  ```text title="Output"
  PATH                                                SDK     PID    CLI_PID  DASHBOARD
  ./src/MyApp.AppHost/MyApp.AppHost.csproj            13.3.0  12345  12340    https://localhost:17244/login?t=abc123
  /home/user/other/OtherApp.AppHost.csproj            13.3.0  67890  67885    https://localhost:17250/login?t=def456
  ```

- Output running AppHosts as JSON for scripting:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire ps --format Json
  ```

  Example output:

  ```json title="Output"
  [
    {
      "appHostPath": "./src/MyApp.AppHost/MyApp.AppHost.csproj",
      "appHostPid": 12345,
      "cliPid": 12340,
      "logFilePath": "~/.aspire/logs/cli_20260516T123456_abc12345.log",
      "dashboardUrl": "https://localhost:17244/login?t=abc123"
    }
  ]
  ```

  The `logFilePath` property is `null` when no log path is available for the AppHost.

- Stream AppHost lifecycle updates as NDJSON and pipe to `jq`:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire ps --follow --format Json | jq -c '{ appHostPath, status }'
  ```
