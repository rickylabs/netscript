# aspire wait command

## Name

`aspire wait` - Wait for a resource to reach a target status.

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire wait <resource> [options]
```

## Description

The `aspire wait` command blocks until a named resource within a running AppHost reaches a target
status. This is useful for CI/CD pipelines and automation workflows where you need to wait for
resources to be ready after starting an AppHost with `aspire run --detach`.

The `--timeout` option here controls how long to wait for a _resource_ to reach its target status.
It's separate from the `ASPIRE_CLI_START_TIMEOUT` environment variable, which controls how long
`aspire run` and `aspire start` wait for the _AppHost itself_ to finish starting up. See
[aspire run](/reference/cli/commands/aspire-run/#configuring-the-startup-timeout) for details.

The command connects to a running AppHost via the backchannel and streams resource state changes in
real-time. It validates that the specified resource exists before entering the wait loop, so typos
in resource names are caught immediately rather than causing a silent timeout.

When executed without the `--apphost` option, the command:

1. Scans for all running AppHost processes.
2. If multiple AppHosts are running within the current directory scope, prompts you to select which
   one to target.
3. If only one AppHost is running in scope, connects to it directly.
4. If no in-scope AppHosts are found but out-of-scope AppHosts exist, displays all running AppHosts
   for selection.

## Arguments

- **`<resource>`**

  The name of the resource to wait for. This must match the name of a resource defined in the
  running AppHost.

## Options

The following options are available:

- **`--status <healthy|up|down>`**

  The target status to wait for. Defaults to `healthy`. The following values are supported:

  | Value     | Condition                                                                    |
  | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `healthy` | Resource is running and healthy, or running with no health checks configured |
  | `up`      | Resource is running, regardless of health status                             |
  | `down`    | Resource has finished, exited, or failed to start                            |

  Values are case-insensitive.

- **`--timeout <seconds>`**

  The maximum number of seconds to wait for the resource to reach the target status. Defaults to
  `120`. Must be a positive integer.

- **`--apphost <apphost>`**

  The path to the Aspire AppHost project file. When specified, the command connects to the AppHost
  running from that apphost without prompting for selection.

## Examples

- Wait for a resource to be healthy (default):

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire wait webfrontend
  ```

- Wait for a resource to be running:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire wait mydb --status up
  ```

- Wait for a resource to stop:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire wait worker --status down
  ```

- Wait with a custom timeout of 60 seconds:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire wait webfrontend --timeout 60
  ```

- Target a specific AppHost project:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire wait mydb --apphost './src/MyApp.AppHost/MyApp.AppHost.csproj'
  ```

- Use with `aspire run --detach` in a CI/CD pipeline:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire run --detach
  aspire wait webfrontend
  aspire wait mydb --status healthy
  ```
