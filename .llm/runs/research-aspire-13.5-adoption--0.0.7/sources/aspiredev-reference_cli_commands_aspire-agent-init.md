## Description

The `aspire agent init` command initializes Aspire skills, companion tools, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) server configuration for your development environment. It presents an interactive multi-step flow to configure AI coding agent support:

1. **Select skill locations** — choose where skill files are installed (Standard `.agents/skills/`, Claude Code `.claude/skills/`, GitHub Skills `.github/skills/`, OpenCode `.opencode/skill/`). The **Standard** location is the only option that defaults as pre-selected.
2. **Select skills and tools** — choose which Aspire workflow skills and companion tools to install. The Aspire workflow skills come from the Aspire skills bundle; optional companion tools such as `playwright-cli` and `dotnet-inspect` can be selected explicitly.
3. **Apply selections** — installs the chosen skills into each selected location and sets up the MCP server connection.

The command also removes skill files from any locations that were deselected, keeping your workspace clean.

**Aspire workflow skills bundle:** Aspire workflow skills are distributed through the
  [`microsoft/aspire-skills`](https://github.com/microsoft/aspire-skills) GitHub
  release assets. Aspire 13.4 includes an embedded snapshot for default
  installs, and the optional remote fetch path can download matching release
  assets. The CLI verifies bundle integrity before installing selected files.
  The `playwright-cli` and `dotnet-inspect` companion options aren't part of
  that bundle and are installed separately when selected.

### Skills catalog and defaults

The Aspire skills bundle includes six workflow skills: `aspire`, `aspire-init`, `aspire-orchestration`, `aspire-monitoring`, `aspire-deployment`, and `aspireify`. The CLI reads the bundle catalog, so bundle-provided skills are available in the interactive prompt and through `--skills` by name.

Standalone `aspire agent init` pre-selects the bundle skills that are safe to add to an existing workspace: `aspire`, `aspire-init`, `aspire-orchestration`, `aspire-monitoring`, and `aspire-deployment`. The `aspireify` skill remains available but opt-in because it's a one-time AppHost wiring workflow. When `aspire init` chains into agent setup, `aspireify` is pre-selected because it is the natural follow-up after adding an AppHost skeleton to an existing repository.

### Bundle integrity verification

The CLI verifies the embedded and remotely-fetched Aspire skills bundle using
SHA-512 checksums. Per-file hashes recorded in bundles published before the
SHA-512 switch continue to validate against SHA-256.

### Installation summary

When one or more skill files are installed or updated, the command prints a single compact summary instead of one message per skill. For example, a standalone install of the default Aspire workflow skills into the standard workspace and user-level locations reports:

```text title="Output"
🤖 Installed Aspire agent skills:
  Skills: aspire, aspire-deployment, aspire-init, aspire-monitoring, aspire-orchestration
  Locations: .agents/skills, ~/.agents/skills
✅ Agent environment configuration complete.
```

If a skill install fails, the error message includes the exact skill path that failed. No-op runs, where every selected skill is already up to date, skip the skills and locations summary and print only the final completion message.

  bundle errors](/get-started/aspire-skills/#troubleshoot-skill-bundle-errors).

## Options

The following options are available:

- **`--workspace-root <workspace-root>`**

  Path to the workspace root directory. When not specified, the current directory is used as the workspace root.

- **`--skill-locations <skill-locations>`**

  Comma-separated list of skill locations to configure, such as `standard`, `claudecode`, `github`, or `opencode`. Use `all` to configure all supported locations or `none` to skip skill location configuration. When not specified, the command prompts interactively.

- **`--skills <skills>`**

  Comma-separated list of skills to install. Aspire 13.4 includes the Aspire workflow skills `aspire`, `aspire-init`, `aspire-orchestration`, `aspire-monitoring`, `aspire-deployment`, and `aspireify`; companion options can include `playwright-cli` and, for .NET AppHosts, `dotnet-inspect`. The available list can vary by Aspire CLI version and project type. Use `all` to install all available skills or `none` to skip skill installation. When not specified, the command prompts interactively.

## Examples

- Initialize AI agent configuration for detected agent environments:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire agent init
  ```

- Install all Aspire workflow skills from the Aspire skills bundle in the standard location:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire agent init --skill-locations standard --skills aspire,aspire-init,aspire-orchestration,aspire-monitoring,aspire-deployment,aspireify
  ```

- Install all available skills and companion options in all supported skill locations:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire agent init --skills all --skill-locations all
  ```

- Initialize agent configuration from a specific workspace root:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire agent init --workspace-root ./src
  ```
