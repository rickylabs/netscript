# Upgrade Aspire to the latest version

Upgrade Aspire by updating the **Aspire CLI** and the Aspire packages used by your app. The `aspire update` command handles most package updates for supported AppHost configurations, but you should also review breaking changes and update tooling extensions.

**Note:** If you're new to Aspire, there's no reason to upgrade anything. See [prerequisites](/get-started/prerequisites/) and [install Aspire CLI](/get-started/install-cli/) to get started.

## Upgrade with the Aspire CLI

1. **Update the Aspire CLI** to the latest version:

   ```bash title="Update the Aspire CLI"
    aspire update --self
    ```

    If you installed the CLI from npm or as a .NET tool, `aspire update --self` prints the matching package-manager command to run (for example, `npm install -g @microsoft/aspire-cli@latest`) instead of replacing a package-manager-owned binary. See [Updating the CLI based on how it was installed](/reference/cli/commands/aspire-update/#updating-the-cli-based-on-how-it-was-installed).

2. **Update your Aspire app** by running:

   ```bash title="Update your Aspire app"
    aspire update
    ```

    This command automatically:

    - Detects outdated Aspire integrations, templates, and SDK version
    - Updates the SDK version and Aspire integration versions for the configured Aspire channel
    - Handles versions declared inline, in `aspire.config.json`, or in supported centralized version files

## Update the VS Code extension (optional)

If you have the Aspire extension installed, you can update it to get the latest tooling support:

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to **Extensions** (<Kbd windows="Ctrl+Shift+X" mac="Command+Shift+X" />)
3. Search for **Aspire**
4. Click **Update** if an update is available

## Remove the legacy workload (Aspire 8 only)

If you're upgrading from Aspire 8 and your machine has the legacy Aspire workload installed, remove it after updating the CLI. For Aspire 9 or later, no action is required.

Remove the **aspire workload** with the following command:

```bash title="Remove the legacy Aspire workload"
dotnet workload uninstall aspire
```

## Verify the upgrade

After upgrading, run your application to ensure everything works as expected:

```bash title="Run the Aspire application"
aspire run
```
