# aspire update command

## Name

`aspire update` - Update Aspire packages and templates in your project.

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire update [options]
```

## Description

The `aspire update` command helps you keep your Aspire projects current by automatically detecting and updating outdated packages and templates. It finds outdated Aspire NuGet packages while respecting channel configurations and intelligently handles complex dependency graphs.

<Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/project-search-logic-description.md" />

The command performs the following:

- Detects outdated Aspire NuGet packages in your project
- Respects your configured Aspire channel (preview, stable, etc.)
- Resolves diamond dependencies to avoid duplicate updates
- Applies all package version edits before running a single final `dotnet restore`, so channel switches that add NuGet source mappings don't cause restore failures mid-update
- Provides colorized output with detailed summary of changes

### Non-interactive usage

When you use `--non-interactive`, also pass `--yes` to explicitly confirm the update operation. Omitting `--yes` when using `--non-interactive` is an error:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire update --yes --non-interactive
```

If you specify `--non-interactive` without `--yes`, the command exits with an error:

```text title="Output"
The update command requires --yes when the --non-interactive option is specified.
```

### Updating guest AppHost projects

When updating a guest AppHost project, such as a TypeScript AppHost, `aspire update` checks the selected Aspire SDK version before modifying files. If the selected SDK is newer than the running Aspire CLI, the command prompts you to update the CLI first:

```text title="Output"
The selected Aspire SDK is newer than this Aspire CLI. Update the Aspire CLI now and re-run `aspire update` to update this project?
```

If you confirm, the CLI updates itself and skips the project update. When the CLI is installed from npm or as a .NET tool, the command prints the matching package-manager update command to run manually instead:

```text title="Output"
Project update skipped. Update the Aspire CLI, then re-run `aspire update`.
```

After updating the CLI, re-run `aspire update` to complete the project update. This check helps prevent a guest AppHost project from being left in a broken state when the CLI's bundled code generator doesn't support the selected SDK version.

:::tip
To update the CLI without being prompted, run `aspire update --self` before running `aspire update` on a guest AppHost project.

### Updating the CLI based on how it was installed

`aspire update --self` (and the update notice shown when a newer version is available) adapts to how the CLI was installed so it doesn't overwrite files owned by a package manager:

- When the CLI was installed from **npm** (the `@microsoft/aspire-cli` package), the command prints the npm update command to run instead of downloading a new binary:

  ```text title="Output"
  To update the Aspire CLI when installed from npm, run:
    npm install -g @microsoft/aspire-cli@latest
  ```

- When the CLI was installed with the **install script** or another **binary install**, `aspire update --self` downloads and installs the latest CLI binary directly.
- When the CLI was installed as a **.NET tool**, the command prints the `dotnet tool update` command to run.
- When the CLI was installed via **Nix** (profile or flake), the command prints the Nix update commands to run instead of downloading a new binary. Because the Nix store is read-only, in-place binary updates are not possible:

  ```text title="Output"
  To update the Aspire CLI when installed from Nix, update the profile package or flake input:
    nix profile upgrade aspire-cli
    nix flake update <input-name>
  ```

  Run `nix profile upgrade aspire-cli` for a profile install, or `nix flake update <input-name>` for a project flake.

## Options

The following options are available:

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-project.md" />

- **`--self`**

  Update the Aspire CLI itself to the latest version. The CLI adapts to how it was installed: npm and .NET tool installs print the matching package-manager command to run, while install-script and other binary installs download the latest binary directly. See [Updating the CLI based on how it was installed](#updating-the-cli-based-on-how-it-was-installed).

- **`--channel`**

  Channel to update to (`stable`, `staging`, `daily`). When switching channels, `aspire update` applies all package version edits to your project first and then runs a single `dotnet restore`, ensuring that NuGet source mappings added for the target channel are in place before any restore is attempted.

  For non-stable channels (`staging`, `daily`), `aspire update` creates or updates a project-level `nuget.config` with the source mappings needed to resolve packages from that channel's feed. For the `stable` channel, no `nuget.config` is created because nuget.org is already the default NuGet source. If an existing `nuget.config` is present and the project has package or channel updates to apply when switching to or using `stable`, those changes are applied as part of that update to remove any stale channel-specific feed entries. If the project is already up to date, `aspire update` reports this and exits before touching `nuget.config`, so a stale channel-specific feed entry from a previous `staging` or `daily` switch can remain until the next update that actually applies changes.

  When you switch to a persistable channel, such as `daily`, `aspire update` also rewrites the top-level `channel` key in `aspire.config.json` when the file already exists. Only channels registered as _explicit_ channels are persisted, with one exception: the `stable` channel is treated as the portable default and is intentionally not pinned. The persisted channel keeps subsequent `aspire add` and `aspire update` runs resolving packages against the channel you just switched to.

  The `staging` channel can only be resolved from a `stable` or `staging` Aspire CLI build. Daily, local, and per-PR CLI builds don't have a deterministic staging feed, so requesting `--channel staging` from one of them fails with an error naming the running CLI's identity and pointing at the recovery options: install a staging or stable Aspire CLI, or set the `overrideStagingFeed` configuration value (for example, `aspire config set -g overrideStagingFeed <feed-url>`) to point at the staging feed you want to use. See [`overrideStagingFeed`](/reference/cli/configuration/#settings-surfaced-by-aspire-config) in the CLI configuration reference.

- **`-y, --yes`**

  Automatically confirm all prompts without user input. Use this option in CI/CD pipelines or other non-interactive environments to skip confirmation dialogs.

- **`--nuget-config-dir`**

  Path to the directory containing the `NuGet.Config` file to use when searching for packages. When not specified, the command searches for a `NuGet.Config` file in the current directory and its parents.

## Examples

- Analyze and update out-of-date Aspire packages and templates:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire update
  ```

- Update a specific AppHost project:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire update --apphost './projects/apphost/orchestration.AppHost.csproj'
  ```

- Update packages in a CI/CD pipeline without interactive prompts:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire update --yes --non-interactive
  ```

- Update packages using a specific NuGet configuration file:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire update --nuget-config-dir './config'
  ```

- Update packages to the daily preview channel:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire update --channel daily
