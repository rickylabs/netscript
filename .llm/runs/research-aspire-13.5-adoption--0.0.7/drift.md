# Drift log

## D-1 — Owner route override

- Severity: intentional
- Baseline policy: planning orchestration normally routes to Opus 5 high; Fable 5 medium is the
  deep-analysis lane.
- Owner decision: this standalone harness research orchestrator must use Fable 5 medium.
- Action: record requested and observed identity and keep the route for the run.

## D-2 — Scope expanded beyond migration

- Severity: plan-shaping
- Owner correction: the epic must cover Aspire MCP plus all static resources and docs so NetScript
  is fully aligned with the latest Aspire release.
- Action: `supervisor.md` makes canonical-source and regeneration-chain coverage mandatory.

## D-3 — `?aspire-lang=typescript` has no effect on the Markdown form

- Severity: minor (method)
- Observation: aspire.dev serves Markdown at `<page>.md`; the query string does not change the
  response (byte-identical for the What's New page). The Markdown contains both C# and `apphost.mts`
  tabs.
- Action: TypeScript claims are taken from the `apphost.mts`/`twoslash` fences and from the
  generated TypeScript API reference (`reference/api/typescript/aspire.hosting`), which is the
  authoritative TS surface. Recorded in `sources/README.md`.

## D-4 — Upstream documentation contradicts itself on TypeScript feature availability

- Severity: minor (evidence)
- Observation: `app-host/container-files` and `fundamentals/health-checks` still say the TS APIs are
  "not yet available"; the 13.5 What's New and the 13.5.1 TS API reference expose them.
- Action: trust the API reference; `research.md` §11 lists every discrepancy so nobody "fixes"
  NetScript to match a stale page.

## D-5 — Remote Control cannot be enabled from inside the turn

- Severity: process
- Observation: `/rc` is a user-side slash command; the orchestrator can only record the observed
  session URL (`https://claude.ai/code/session_011Ng6hnMLyY8vzM8EJo2XKg`). Effort level is not
  introspectable from inside the session.
- Action: recorded in `supervisor.md`; the owner verifies `/status` and keeps `/rc` on.

## D-6 — Repo already partially on 13.5

- Severity: plan-shaping
- Observation: `.github/workflows/e2e-cli-prod.yml` pins Aspire CLI `13.5.0-preview.1.26404.10` (for
  aspire#18948/#18958) while every other pin is 13.4.6 and the NuGet cache key is `13.4.6-v1`; the
  policy test asserts both literals.
- Action: plan D-1/D-8 converge everything on 13.5.3 in S1; the preview's rationale shipped in
  13.5.0.

## D-7 — Standing scaffold assumption about CommunityToolkit projection is stale

- Severity: plan-shaping
- Observation: `generate-aspire-config.ts:44-56` and the arch-debt entry assume `[AspireExport]`
  from external NuGets is not projected into the TS SDK; the aspire.dev TS API reference lists
  `CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.Deno` (`addDenoApp`, `addDenoTask`).
- Action: not adopted in 0.0.7 (D-4); S2 V9 proves it at restore time, S12 spikes it in 0.0.8.

## D-8 — Coordinator scope expansion to whole-ecosystem alignment

- Severity: plan-shaping
- Owner/coordinator correction (2026-08-29): audit and dispose every Aspire-bound surface (MCP
  server/client, static resources, generated snapshots/schemas, skills/corpora/prompts, CI
  workflows/fixtures, examples/templates, dashboard/telemetry bridge, all docs) with one
  authoritative source and one repo-path disposition; include cleanup in the issue graph.
- Action: `stale-surface-inventory.md` (7 surface classes, archival exemption list), research
  C26–C31 + §12a, plan D-11/D-12, new slice S-13, epic pillar 7.

## D-9 — S-09 acceptance was prose-only

- Severity: acceptance
- Correction: S-09 must prove the MCP upgrade behaviour with a structured receipt tied to S-01/S-02.
- Action: `sub-issues/09` rewritten (Part A smoke gate `agent.aspire-mcp-smoke`, JSON receipt path
  `.llm/tmp/gate-receipts/<job>/agent.aspire-mcp-smoke.json`, committed copy
  `receipts/aspire-13.5-mcp-smoke.json`); 13.4.6 baseline captured now in
  `receipts/aspire-13.4.6-mcp-baseline.json` (executed via the session's Aspire MCP server —
  `doctor` + tool discovery; no AppHost started).

## D-10 — Shipped skill's 13.4.6 MCP table is already incomplete

- Severity: minor (evidence)
- Observation: the 13.4.6 server exposes `refresh_tools`, which the "verified tool set on 13.4.6"
  table in `skills/aspire/SKILL.md` omits. Not a 13.5 change; S-09's receipt-driven table fixes it.

## D-11 — PLAN-EVAL cycle 1 FAIL_PLAN and bounded repair

- Severity: plan-shaping
- Verdict: `plan-eval.md` (head `d8caa507e`, evaluator Codex · Sol · high) — F1 health contract, F2
  canary/stable admission, F3 MCP ownership/lifecycle, F4 parity phases, F5 wave completeness +
  manifest, F6 jsr-audit, F7 rendering/staleness.
- Action: all seven corrected in one research-only commit (mapping in `worklog.md`); decisions
  D-5/D-6/D-10 revised, D-13/D-14 added, D-17 opened (dashboard-port assumption, resolve before
  S-13); S6b (protocol-level readiness) deferred to 0.0.8; `aspire-surface-manifest.tsv` + generator
  committed. No second evaluation cycle was launched.

## D-12 — PLAN-EVAL cycle 2 (final) FAIL_PLAN and consistency repair

- Severity: plan-shaping
- Verdict: `plan-eval-cycle-2.md` (head `1bfe60b05`) — six consistency findings; root cause of most
  of them: the cycle-1 repair's scripted `plan.md` replacements silently missed after `deno fmt`
  re-padded table cells (the exact `fmt-rewrap-breaks-string-patches` trap), so D-10/slice table/
  rollback/risk/ratification stayed on the two-canary/12-slice text while the DAG and canary table
  were already correct.
- Action: `plan.md` rewritten in full; MCP semantics corrected (`excludeFromMcp()` ≠
  `withHidden()`); parity phases made executable with the run dir + debt registry archival and
  compat fixtures / lock files special-cased; S13 everywhere; `SAGAS_API_DEFAULT_PORT` retained as
  deprecated compat export; truncated rows reconstructed; deployment owned by S4 (D-15); D-17
  default locked. Every scripted edit was re-verified by grep before commit. No third ordinary
  PLAN-EVAL; next step is coordinator ratification.

## D-13 — Resume turns drop the requested effort

- Severity: minor (route)
- Observation: `launch-codex-slice` matched openai · gpt-5.6-sol · medium for S1, but
  `run-codex-slice` → `codex-resume` (`codex exec resume`) carries no `--effort`, so `codex-status`
  reports the later turns at the profile default `high`.
- Action: recorded; review pairing unchanged (Fable, medium+); agentic-suite follow-up to propagate
  effort on resume (not an S1 concern).

## D-14 — Baseline Fresh type error blocks the CI runtime verdict

- Severity: significant (blocker for S1 draft→ready; not S1-caused)
- Observation: `packages/fresh/src/application/query/hydration.ts:43` TS2345 fails generated-project
  `deno task check` (`generated.quality-negative`, `generated.service-check`) at base `3b32d1628`;
  blob identical at S1 head. Aspire-specific gates through `runtime.aspire-restore` are green on
  13.5.3.
- Action: surfaced to the primary coordinator for the 0.0.7 fixes lane; S1 stays draft until the
  baseline is green or the coordinator admits S1 on the Aspire-specific evidence.

## D-15 — Aspire MCP 13.5.3 exposes 14 tools; `get_integration_docs` is documented but absent

- Severity: plan-shaping (S-09 acceptance)
- Observation (S2 V8, exact host CLI 13.5.3+b5f1433, stdio `aspire agent mcp` from the generated
  project root, 2026-08-29T22:47Z): `tools/list` = the same 14 tools as the committed 13.4.6
  baseline (`refresh_tools` present); `get_integration_docs` — listed by
  `sources/aspiredev-get-started_aspire-mcp-server.md` — is **not** exposed. Receipts:
  `.llm/runs/test-aspire-13-5-s2-runtime-verification--impl/receipts/03-v8-*` on
  `test/aspire-13-5-s2-runtime-verification`.
- Action: S-09's smoke expectation becomes the **executed** 13.5.3 set (14 tools; `baselineDiff`
  empty); the receipt records `get_integration_docs` as a documented-but-absent tool (upstream doc
  discrepancy §11 item 6) and treats its later appearance as `info`, not `fail`. Issue #1721 gets a
  comment; `research.md` C16/C27 get an errata line at the next research-dir edit.

## D-16 — Isolated starts reuse the generated Postgres host port (S2 V3)

- Severity: significant (product; S5 scope)
- Observation: two consecutive `aspire start --isolated` runs of the same generated project both
  bound Postgres to host port 14428; `verify-live-db-endpoint` exited 1.
  `DcpPublisher__RandomizePorts` does not cover the generated infrastructure `withHostPort`/endpoint
  pins.
- Action: S5 (#1717) must include infrastructure host-port pins in the literal-port removal / opt-in
  policy; S10 keeps the gate; noted on #1717.

## D-17b — Cold start 38.6 s and web readiness timeout on 13.5.3 (S2 V2)

- Severity: minor (evidence)
- Observation: time-to-`dashboardUrl` 38.6 s cold / 24.8 s warm on this host (skill baseline 13 s on
  13.4.6, different machine state); web readiness timed out because Prisma/Zod generated output was
  absent until `db generate` ran; browser-log child `NotStarted`.
- Action: S9 replaces the skill timing claim with measured ranges; S10 orders db codegen before the
  readiness wait; not an Aspire regression claim without a same-host 13.4.6 control.

## D-18 — 2026-08-30 — S5 does not close #1365 (OF-3a drift)

- **What:** Ratified OF-3a / #1717 box 6 had S5's PR close #1365, #1370, #979. At IMPL-EVAL PASS
  (`slices/s5/evaluate-cycle-2.md` F-2) the #1365 acceptance boxes for docs-site embedding
  (S11), "discarding a publish result fails type-check/lint" (declined by locked D-14), and
  restart/duplicate/out-of-order/OTEL-correlation proofs are not met by S5.
- **Action:** PR #1740 references `Part of #1365` with the remaining scope listed; #1370 and #979
  keep closing keywords. Coordinator to either amend #1365's boxes (D-14 decision) or route the
  remainder to S11 + a sagas follow-up. Severity: minor (scope honesty, no code impact).

## D-19 — 2026-08-30 — S6 endpoint projection API corrected against restored 13.5.3 module

- **What:** Issue #1718 (line 44) and plan D3 locked host/port resolution at check time via
  `getEndpoint('tcp').property(EndpointProperty.Host|Port)` ("13.4+ thenable chain"). S6 IMPL-EVAL
  cycle 1 compiled a generated AppHost against S2's restored 13.5.3 `.aspire/modules/aspire.mts`
  and found `property()` yields `EndpointReferenceExpression` handles; the value API is
  `getEndpoint('tcp').host()` / `.port()`. `HealthCheckResult.data` is `Record<string, string>`.
- **Action:** intent unchanged (live host/port per invocation, no credentials); projection call and
  `data` typing corrected in S6 slice 6. **Process:** a consumer type-check of a generated AppHost
  against the restored 13.5.3 modules is now a mandatory Tier-A + IMPL-EVAL gate for every
  generator slice (S4/S5 to be re-checked retroactively by the supervisor). Severity: significant
  (would have shipped rejecting health checks).

## D-20 — 2026-08-30 — S5 is red on live CI; its IMPL-EVAL PASS is void

- **Severity:** significant (product; blocks S5 and, by stacking, S6).
- **What:** the context pack recorded S5 (#1717 / PR #1740) as Tier-A ×3 + IMPL-EVAL cycle 2 PASS,
  `status:ready-merge`, close-gate PASS. Live GitHub at `0bd8ba832` says otherwise:
  `mergeStateStatus=BLOCKED`, `check-test` FAIL and `close-gate` FAIL in run `33286543750`.
- **Evidence (four verified defects, all confirmed by supervisor read, not inferred):**
  - **F-1** `check-test` fails at `plugins/ai/tests/manifest_test.ts:56` —
    `AssertionError: actual 0 / expected 8095`. S5 removed `officialSource.backgroundPort: 8095`
    from `plugins/ai/scaffold.plugin.json` but left the assertion in place. 4279 passed / 1 failed.
  - **F-2** `plugins/{workers,auth,sagas,triggers}/streams/factory.ts` replaced the
    `options.baseUrl ?? 'http://localhost:4437'` literal with a `requiredStreamsBaseUrl()` that
    **throws** on an omitted `baseUrl`. `buildStreamUrl(path, baseUrl?)` already falls back to
    `getStreamsUrl()` (`DURABLE_STREAMS_URL` → `services__streams__http__0` →
    `VITE_services__streams__http__0`/`VITE_STREAMS_URL`), so S5 deleted the working
    Aspire-discovery path along with the literal. Valid Aspire-wired callers now fail.
  - **F-3** `packages/cli/.../install/install-plugin.ts:574` leaves `hostPort` unset on a normal
    install while the CLI completion still announces `plugin.servicePort` — post-S5 that is only a
    deterministic template port, never the endpoint Aspire allocates.
  - **F-4** `.llm/tools/validation/check-aspire-host-ports.ts:50` evaluates
    `CONTRIBUTION_PORT_FALLBACK` one line at a time, so a multiline `ctx.port(resource,\n port)`
    escapes the fitness gate it exists to enforce.
  - F-2..F-4 are the three unanswered `augmentcode` review threads that fail
    `agentic:review-threads` (`threads=3 unanswered=3`).
- **Action:** S5 repair dispatched as a new Codex slice (thread
  `01a0515b-8f4a-7412-a151-42d5fb4258d7`, worktree `007-aspire-s5`, brief
  `slices/s5/repair/brief.md`). The prior IMPL-EVAL PASS does not carry to the repaired head — S5
  needs a fresh Tier-A review and a fresh independent IMPL-EVAL before it can be considered
  merge-ready again. **Coordinator decision required:** `status:ready-merge` and `impl-eval:skip`
  are currently live on a red PR; this session does not relabel.
- **Process lesson:** a recorded IMPL-EVAL PASS is not a durable merge signal — live CI and the
  review-thread gate must be re-read at reconciliation time, because both can go red after the
  verdict was written.

## D-21 — 2026-08-30 — Codex agentic lane needed `--user node` on the NAS

- **Severity:** minor (tooling; recovered).
- **What:** `.llm/tools/agentic/lib/agentic-lib.ts` defaults the WSL identity to user `codex`. On
  the NAS the Linux user is `node`, so every agentic Codex command aborted with
  `Cannot run WSL command locally as requested user "codex"`.
- **Action:** all agentic Codex invocations on the NAS pass `--user node`
  (`NETSCRIPT_WSL_USER` is not readable by `agentic:codex-status`, which runs without
  `--allow-env`). The daemon itself survived the migration: app-server `0.151.0`, control socket
  `/home/agent/.codex/app-server-control/app-server-control.sock`, `remoteControlEnabled: true`.
  Not an Aspire-scope defect; recorded so later slices do not rediscover it.

## D-22 — 2026-08-30 — stray `aspire ps` core dump in the supervisor worktree

- **Severity:** minor (hygiene).
- **What:** a 116 MB untracked `core` (ELF core dump from `aspire ps --no-logo`, execfn
  `/home/agent/.local/aspire/aspire`) was sitting in the supervisor worktree after migration.
  `--no-logo` is not a valid 13.5.3 flag; the correct form is `--nologo`.
- **Action:** archived to `/home/agent/observability/aspire-13.5/` (never committed). The runtime
  precondition proof uses `aspire ps --format Json --nologo --non-interactive`, which returns `[]`
  cleanly with no dump. S9's skill/doc line should carry the `--nologo` spelling.

## D-23 — 2026-08-30 — S5 repair left the agent-tools barrel stale (brief defect, not author error)

- **Severity:** minor (gate evidence; blocks S5 CI).
- **What:** PR #1740 at repair head `f3b3e75e` is red on the `quality` job step "Generated asset
  freshness" (run `33297719237`, job `99220213430`). `check:assets-barrel` runs
  `gen:assets-barrel && git diff --exit-code` over the seven generated barrels and exits 1: the
  receipt diff is confined to `packages/cli/src/kernel/assets/agent-tools.generated.ts`, where
  `EMBEDDED_AGENT_TOOL_BUNDLE_HASH` moves
  `2549200359d6e12f89eb9d9df1d5b88df6154042b8c0b86bf3f3d06cb98abf26` →
  `01b5b9b43a008d21c2dc49fc035358a63f9582156b4af81083f427a9860e7b89`. Verified at the branch head:
  the committed constant is still the pre-edit `2549…` and no `*.generated.ts` was touched between
  `0bd8ba83` and the current head. `check-test` is green — F-1…F-4 themselves landed correctly.
- **Cause:** repair slice 4 edited `.llm/tools/validation/check-aspire-host-ports.ts`, and `.llm/tools`
  sources are embedded in the agent-tools corpus. The repair brief's slice-5 gate list said
  "`check:assets-barrel` **if any generated asset moved**", which understates the coupling — *any*
  `.llm/tools` source edit moves that barrel. **This is a supervisor brief defect**, not an
  implementation error; S6's brief already carried the correct unconditional form.
- **Action:** the same author thread (`01a0515b-8f4a-7412-a151-42d5fb4258d7`) is steered to run
  `gen:assets-barrel`, commit only the authoritative regenerated barrels, **re-cut the slice-5 gate
  evidence at the new exact head** (the `f3b3e75e` table is stale the moment the fix lands), push,
  and drive CI green. Green CI is a precondition for Tier-A and the independent IMPL-EVAL, not a
  substitute for either. No runtime lease granted.
- **Lesson (for the run's brief template):** any slice touching `.llm/tools/**`,
  `.agents/skills/**`, or an embedded-asset source must list `gen:assets-barrel` +
  `check:assets-barrel` as **unconditional** slice gates.

## D-24 — 2026-08-30 — S7 phase-B evidence gap flagged by IMPL-EVAL cycle 2 (non-blocking)

- **Severity:** minor (evidence provenance; phase B only).
- **What:** the cycle-2 IMPL-EVAL `PASS` carries one non-blocking note: `ASPIRE_DCP_APPHOST_PATH`
  has no receipt provenance, and process `cwd` is not ownership evidence.
- **Action:** the S7 phase-B lease brief must capture a **real** orphaned descendant's
  `environ` / `cmdline` / `cwd` / `fd` set and cite it as the receipt behind the ownership
  classification, rather than resting on the synthetic fixture. Folded into the lease queue; does
  not affect the phase-A verdict.

## D-25 — 2026-08-30 — NAS container PID 1 is not reaping; 7.7k zombies produce false process-survival reds

- **Severity:** significant (environment, not product). **Not fixable by any agent.**
- **What (independently verified in this session, read-only):** `ps -eo stat=` reports **7,734
  zombie processes out of 7,844 total** in the `ai-agents` container. **7,562 are PPID-1-owned
  `sshd`** children; the remainder are `git` (61), `node-MainThread` (22), `esbuild` (22), `sleep`,
  `deno`, `sh`, `codex-code-mode`. Container PID 1 is not reaping, and an unprivileged agent cannot
  reap another process's children.
- **Consequence:** any gate that asserts "no surviving/leaked child process" reports a false red.
  The coordinator attributes the hybrid-launcher **cancellation-survivor root test** red to exactly
  this. **Classification: environment artifact, not a code defect.**
- **Standing rule for this run:** do not re-run or chase that root test, and do not attribute it to
  any Aspire slice. **Scoped product gates are judged independently of it** — a slice's verdict rests
  on its own scoped wrappers, `quality:scan`, `arch:check`, `check:assets-barrel`, and its targeted
  suites, never on the root process-survival suite while this condition holds.
- **Carried into evaluator briefs:** every Aspire IMPL-EVAL brief from this point must name this
  red as known-infra so the evaluator does not return `FAIL_FIX` on it.
- **Owner action (agent-blocked):** the container needs a reaping init (or a restart) on the host.
  Secondary risk: ~7.8k processes is within reach of PID/thread limits, which would start failing
  unrelated spawns. This is a human/host action — flagged, not attempted.

## D-26 — 2026-08-30 — `check:publish-assets` is a second derived-asset trap; S5 verified clear

- **Severity:** minor (gate coverage; no S5 impact).
- **Source:** the 0.0.7 docs lane hit this on PR #1746 — `check:assets-barrel` and
  `check:agent-docs-prose` were green at the pushed head, Tier-A re-ran them, and an independent
  IMPL-EVAL re-ran them; CI still failed on "Publish asset freshness". Their brief had barred
  regenerating `packages/mcp/src/publish-assets.generated.ts` on a lane rule claiming it "embeds
  `packages/mcp/README.md` only" — a false premise, so the gate never reached the list and no
  amount of independent review could catch it. Repair was one line, `'sourceCommit'`.
- **Input set** (`.llm/tools/generate-publish-assets.ts:34-40`):
  `.llm/assets/agent-docs/{prose.json.gz,provenance.json}`,
  `packages/cli/src/kernel/assets/{agent-tools,agent-docs,embedded,skills}.generated.ts`,
  `packages/plugin/src/kernel/assets/embedded.generated.ts`.
- **Verified for S5 (negative result, taken at the exact head):** S5's `59728705` regenerates
  `agent-tools.generated.ts`, which *is* on that input list, yet `deno task check:publish-assets`
  **exits 0** at `f0de60a1`. Run in a throwaway detached worktree so the author's tree was never
  touched. **S5 needs no publish-assets commit.**
- **Refined rule:** the trigger is not "an input path changed" but "an input whose content actually
  reaches the emitted output". The docs lane's failure came from **agent-docs corpus regeneration**
  moving `provenance.json`'s `sourceCommit`, which is embedded; S5 moved
  `EMBEDDED_AGENT_TOOL_BUNDLE_HASH` and embedded tool bodies without touching the agent-docs corpus,
  so nothing emitted moved.
- **Action:** `gen:publish-assets` + `check:publish-assets` join `gen:assets-barrel` +
  `check:assets-barrel` as **unconditional** slice gates for every corpus-touching slice — S9
  (corpora/skills), S13, and the S7 playbook rows are the exposed ones. Generalises D-23: the brief
  rule is **"any generated asset whose *inputs* your diff touches"**, never a memorised file list.
  A conditional phrasing ("if any generated asset moved") is what let both D-23 and #1746 through.

## D-27 — 2026-08-30 — Mermaid `%%` comments do not reach the rendered SVG (terminology rows are diagram-safe)

- **Severity:** trivial (unblocks an S11 row).
- **Question:** the docs lane asked whether changing the `.NET Aspire` string in the `%%` comment at
  `docs/site/_diagrams/aspire-resource-graph.mmd:2` would move the rendered artifact and hand this
  run a spurious diagram diff.
- **Evidence:** `docs/site/assets/diagrams/aspire-resource-graph.svg` (21,680 bytes) contains **zero**
  occurrences of `.NET Aspire`, of the comment line text, of `%%`, and of `Theme-neutral` — all four
  `%%` header lines are absent. Only generic `aria-roledescription="flowchart-v2"` metadata; no
  embedded source digest, no timestamp. `diagrams:check` (`docs/site/_diagrams/render.ts`) renders to
  a temp SVG and byte-compares against the committed one, so a comment-only edit renders identically.
- **Limitation stated:** proven from the committed artifact, not from an executed A/B render —
  `mmdc` cannot run in this container (`Permission denied`, noexec scratch, and mermaid-cli needs
  headless Chromium).
- **Answer given:** the terminology row is safe to sweep; it does not need to be deferred, and it
  does not interact with the manifest's "diagrams:render if S6/S8 add nodes" condition (which is
  separately proven NO for S6 — 2 `addContainer` emissions before and after).
