# Drift log

## D-1 — Owner route override

- Severity: intentional
- Baseline policy: planning orchestration normally routes to Opus 5 high; Fable 5 medium is the
  deep-analysis lane.
- Owner decision: this standalone harness research orchestrator must use Fable 5 medium.
- Action: record requested and observed identity and keep the route for the run.

## D-2 — Scope expanded beyond migration

- Severity: plan-shaping
- Owner correction: the epic must cover Aspire MCP plus all static resources and docs so NetScript
  is fully aligned with the latest Aspire release.
- Action: `supervisor.md` makes canonical-source and regeneration-chain coverage mandatory.

## D-3 — `?aspire-lang=typescript` has no effect on the Markdown form

- Severity: minor (method)
- Observation: aspire.dev serves Markdown at `<page>.md`; the query string does not change the
  response (byte-identical for the What's New page). The Markdown contains both C# and `apphost.mts`
  tabs.
- Action: TypeScript claims are taken from the `apphost.mts`/`twoslash` fences and from the
  generated TypeScript API reference (`reference/api/typescript/aspire.hosting`), which is the
  authoritative TS surface. Recorded in `sources/README.md`.

## D-4 — Upstream documentation contradicts itself on TypeScript feature availability

- Severity: minor (evidence)
- Observation: `app-host/container-files` and `fundamentals/health-checks` still say the TS APIs are
  "not yet available"; the 13.5 What's New and the 13.5.1 TS API reference expose them.
- Action: trust the API reference; `research.md` §11 lists every discrepancy so nobody "fixes"
  NetScript to match a stale page.

## D-5 — Remote Control cannot be enabled from inside the turn

- Severity: process
- Observation: `/rc` is a user-side slash command; the orchestrator can only record the observed
  session URL (`https://claude.ai/code/session_011Ng6hnMLyY8vzM8EJo2XKg`). Effort level is not
  introspectable from inside the session.
- Action: recorded in `supervisor.md`; the owner verifies `/status` and keeps `/rc` on.

## D-6 — Repo already partially on 13.5

- Severity: plan-shaping
- Observation: `.github/workflows/e2e-cli-prod.yml` pins Aspire CLI `13.5.0-preview.1.26404.10` (for
  aspire#18948/#18958) while every other pin is 13.4.6 and the NuGet cache key is `13.4.6-v1`; the
  policy test asserts both literals.
- Action: plan D-1/D-8 converge everything on 13.5.3 in S1; the preview's rationale shipped in
  13.5.0.

## D-7 — Standing scaffold assumption about CommunityToolkit projection is stale

- Severity: plan-shaping
- Observation: `generate-aspire-config.ts:44-56` and the arch-debt entry assume `[AspireExport]`
  from external NuGets is not projected into the TS SDK; the aspire.dev TS API reference lists
  `CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.Deno` (`addDenoApp`, `addDenoTask`).
- Action: not adopted in 0.0.7 (D-4); S2 V9 proves it at restore time, S12 spikes it in 0.0.8.
