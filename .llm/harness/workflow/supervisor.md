# Supervisor Workflow

Operating protocol for **supervisor runs** — harness runs that aggregate several capability-scoped
**phase groups**, where each group is its own branch + worktree + nested harness sub-run + sub-PR +
evaluator pass, merged into one integration branch that PRs to the base branch.

> **Provenance.** Promoted from the plugin-platform supervisor run (`feat/plugin-platform-impl`, PR
> #96), which proved this model across 8 groups (sub-PRs #86–#95) and satisfied its own § 8
> promotion criteria. The original lives at `.llm/tmp/run/feat-plugin-platform-impl--supervisor/`
> for history.

## When to use a supervisor run

Use a supervisor run when one deliverable is too large for a single harness run and splits into
**two or more phase groups** with dependency ordering (a multi-wave package program, a platform
rewrite, a release program). A **phase group** is sized to _one reviewable PR with its own evaluator
pass_ — never a single command or file. Single-surface changes use the normal `run-loop.md`.

## Run layout

- **Integration branch**: `feat/<supervisor>` (off the base branch).
- **Supervisor run dir** `.llm/runs/<supervisor-run-id>/`:
  - base templates — `plan.md`, `worklog.md`, `context-pack.md`, `drift.md`;
  - **`phase-registry.md`** from `templates/phase-registry.md` — the group map, ordering, and live
    status;
  - `final-pr-handoff.md` + `escalations/` — produced as groups merge.
- **Each phase group**: branch `feat/<supervisor>-<group>`, a worktree, and a nested run dir
  `<supervisor>-<group>--<suffix>/` with the standard run artifacts (its own Design checkpoint +
  evaluator pass).

## 1. Pre-group checklist

Before launching a phase group:

- [ ] Previous group has evaluator verdict `PASS` (or `FAIL_DEBT` with accepted entries in
      `debt/arch-debt.md`).
- [ ] Integration branch is clean (`git status` shows no uncommitted changes).
- [ ] Base-branch sync is current (see § 5).
- [ ] `drift.md` reviewed — no unresolved `architectural` drift blocking the next group.
- [ ] `phase-registry.md` updated with the new group's status → `active`.
- [ ] The group will run its own Plan-Gate (PLAN-EVAL) before implementation — see `run-loop.md`
      § 4.

## 2. Group launch protocol

```bash
# 1. From the integration worktree, branch the group off the integration branch
git checkout feat/<supervisor>
git pull
git checkout -b feat/<supervisor>-<group>

# 2. Create the group worktree under the gitignored .worktrees/ root
git worktree add .worktrees/<group> feat/<supervisor>-<group>

# 3. Scaffold the group's nested harness run dir from templates/
#    .llm/runs/<supervisor>-<group>--<suffix>/

# 4. Push the group branch and open a DRAFT sub-PR against the integration branch
git push -u origin feat/<supervisor>-<group>
#    base = feat/<supervisor>, head = feat/<supervisor>-<group>
```

**Every phase group is its own draft PR against the integration branch**
(`feat/<supervisor>-<group>` → `feat/<supervisor>`), exactly like the PR #96 group sub-PRs (#86–#95)
and the S0 supervisor (PR #98). All actual implementation — each package refactor — happens **only**
in the group's worktree on its own branch, never directly on the integration branch.

> **Branch naming.** Git cannot create `feat/<supervisor>/<group>` while the branch
> `feat/<supervisor>` exists (ref dir/file conflict), so a group hangs off the integration name with
> a **hyphen**: `feat/<supervisor>-<group>` (S0 used `feat/repo-genesis-genesis`). The worktree dir
> may keep the short `<group>` name.

Brief the group agent with `templates/agent-briefing.md`. The group agent then runs the normal
`run-loop.md` (Research -> Plan & Design -> Plan-Gate/PLAN-EVAL -> sliced implementation -> gates)
and may not commit an implementation slice before PLAN-EVAL returns `PASS`. It produces its run
artifacts and hands off to a **separate evaluator session**. On `PASS`, the integration owner merges
the draft sub-PR `--no-ff` (§ 3) and it closes.

## 3. Merge protocol

After a group's evaluator returns `PASS`:

1. **Pre-merge** — verify the integration branch is current, confirm the group ran the Plan-Gate
   (`plan-eval.md` = `PASS`) before implementation, and `evaluate.md` = `PASS`.
2. **Merge (preserve history):**
   ```bash
   git checkout feat/<supervisor>
   git merge feat/<supervisor>-<group> --no-ff \
     -m "merge(supervisor): <group> (<phases>)"
   ```
   On conflict: **stop, do not force-resolve.** Take the group version for generated artifacts and
   re-generate; merge both entries for `deno.json` workspace members; analyze source conflicts
   manually. Log conflict + resolution in `drift.md` as `significant`.
3. **Post-merge verification** — `deno check` (with project unstable flags) on affected surfaces;
   forbidden-import check; affected tests.
4. **Update supervisor state** — `phase-registry.md` group → `merged` (record merge commit);
   `context-pack.md` group → Completed; `worklog.md` progress; the merge commit is captured in the
   integration PR / sub-PR commit trail.

## 4. Escalation review

After every group merge, run the escalation review in [`escalation.md`](./escalation.md): collect
the merged group's drift/decisions/ open questions, classify, assess impact on pending groups, and
**stop to brief the user** if any escalation changes a pending group's plan, the group ordering, the
dependency graph, or needs a user decision.

## 5. Base-branch sync schedule

| Trigger                                                    | Action                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Before starting each new group                             | merge base branch into integration |
| Base branch gets a significant commit to a touched surface | immediate sync                     |
| Never during an active group                               | wait for group close               |

After sync: verify `deno check` passes, log the sync in `worklog.md`, log any conflicts in
`drift.md`.

## 6. Final integration merge / PR

After the last group passes evaluation:

- [ ] All groups `merged` in `phase-registry.md`.
- [ ] No unresolved `architectural` drift.
- [ ] No open `FAIL_*` verdicts in any group's `evaluate.md`.
- [ ] Workspace `deno check` + affected tests pass on the integration branch.
- [ ] End-to-end / parity gate for the program passes.
- [ ] `deno fmt --check` + `deno lint` pass on changed files.

Then open the supervisor PR to the base branch (the PR #96 shape): summary, merged group/sub-PR
list, validation snapshot, and links to `final-pr-handoff.md` + `context-pack.md` +
`phase-registry.md` + `drift.md`.

## 7. Close

1. Write `final-pr-handoff.md` (what merged, validation snapshot, follow-ups).
2. Update `debt/arch-debt.md` — close resolved, carry forward open.
3. Promote repeated lessons to `lessons/` when the promotion rule is met.
4. Write a dated `.llm/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md` session record.
5. Delete worktrees (keep branches for history).
